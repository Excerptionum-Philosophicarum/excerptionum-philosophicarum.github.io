  <h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>In some remote corner of the universe, flickering in the light of the countless solar systems into which it had been poured, there was once a planet on which clever animals invented cognition. It was the most arrogant and most mendacious minute in the “history of the world”; but a minute was all it was. After nature had drawn just a few more breaths the planet froze and the clever animals had to die. Someone could invent a fable like this and yet they would still not have given a satisfactory illustration of just how pitiful, how insubstantial and transitory, how purposeless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature; there were eternities during which it did not exist; and when it has disappeared again, nothing will have happened. For this intellect has no further mission that might extend beyond the bounds of human life. Rather, the intellect is human, and only its own possessor and progenitor regards it with such pathos, as if it housed the axis around which the entire world revolved.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
It is odd that the intellect can produce this effect, since it is nothing other than an aid supplied to the most unfortunate, most delicate and most transient of beings so as to detain them for a minute within existence [...]&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<p>
As a means for the preservation of the individual, the intellect shows its greatest strengths in dissimulation, since this is the means to preserve those weaker, less robust individuals who, by nature, are denied horns or the sharp fangs of a beast of prey with which to wage the struggle for existence. This art of dissimulation reaches its peak in humankind [...]&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
  
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
What do human beings really know about themselves? Are they even capable of perceiving themselves in their entirety just once, stretched out as in an illuminated glass case? Does nature not remain silent about almost everything, even about our bodies, banishing and enclosing us within a proud, illusory consciousness, far away from the twists and turns of the bowels, the rapid flow of the blood stream and the complicated tremblings of the nerve-fibres? Nature has thrown away the key, and woe betide fateful curiosity should it ever succeed in peering through a crack in the chamber of consciousness, out and down into the depths, and thus gain an intimation of the fact that humanity, in the indifference of its ignorance, rests on the pitiless, the greedy, the insatiable, the murderous — clinging in dreams, as it were, to the back of a tiger. Given this constellation, where on earth can the drive to truth possibly have come from?&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
  
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Human beings do not so much flee from being tricked as from being harmed by being tricked. Even on this level they do not hate deception but rather the damaging, inimical consequences of certain species of deception. Truth, too, is only desired by human beings in a similarly limited sense. They desire the pleasant, life-preserving consequences of truth; they are indifferent to pure knowledge if it has no consequences, but they are actually hostile towards truths which may be harmful and destructive. And, besides, what is the status of those conventions of language?&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
  
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
What is a word? The copy of a nervous stimulation in sounds. To infer from the fact of the nervous stimulation that there exists a cause outside us is already the result of applying the principle of sufficient reason wrongly. If truth alone had been decisive in the genesis of language, if the viewpoint of certainty had been decisive in creating designations, how could we possibly be permitted to say, “the stone is hard”, as if “hard” were something known to us in some other way, and not merely as an entirely subjective stimulus?&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
The “thing-in-itself” (which would be, precisely, pure truth, truth without consequences) is impossible for even the creator of language to grasp, and indeed this is not at all desirable. He designates only the relations of things to human beings, and in order to express them he avails himself of the boldest metaphors. The stimulation of a nerve is first translated into an image: first metaphor! The image is then imitated by a sound: second metaphor!&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
<p>
[...]
</p>
One can conceive of a profoundly deaf human being who has never experienced sound or music; just as such a person will gaze in astonishment at the Chladnian sound-figures in sand, find their cause in the vibration of a string, and swear that he must now know what men call sound — this is precisely what happens to all of us with language.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
<p>
  
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Let us consider in particular how concepts are formed; each word immediately becomes a concept, not by virtue of the fact that it is intended to serve as a memory (say) of the unique, utterly individualized, primary experience to which it owes its existence, but because at the same time it must fit countless other, more or less similar cases, i.e. cases which, strictly speaking, are never equivalent, and thus nothing other than non-equivalent cases. Every concept comes into being by making equivalent that which is non-equivalent.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
  
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Like form, a concept is produced by overlooking what is individual and real, whereas nature knows neither forms nor concepts and hence no species, but only an “X” which is inaccessible to us and indefinable by us. For the opposition we make between individual and species is also anthropomorphic and does not stem from the essence of things, although we equally do not dare to say that it does <i>not</i> correspond to the essence of things, since that would be a dogmatic assertion and, as such, just as incapable of being proved as its opposite.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
<p>
What, then, is truth? A mobile army ofmetaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms, in short a sum of human relations which have been subjected to poetic and rhetorical intensification, translation, and decoration, and which, after they have been in use for a long time, strike a people as firmly established, canonical, and binding; truths are illusions ofwhich we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have become worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigour, coins which, having lost their stamp, are now regarded as metal and no longer as coins.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
<p>
[...]
</p>
<p>
Now, it is true that human beings forget that this is how things are; thus they lie unconsciously in the way we have described, and in accordance with centuries-old habits — and precisely <i>because of this unconsciousness</i>, precisely because of this forgetting, they arrive at the feeling of truth.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
As creatures of <i>reason</i>, human beings now make their actions subject to the rule of abstractions; they no longer tolerate being swept away by sudden impressions and sensuous perceptions; they now generalize all these impressions first, turning them into cooler, less colourful concepts in order to harness the vehicle of their lives and actions to them. Everything which distinguishes human beings from animals depends on this ability to sublimate sensuous metaphors into a schema, in other words, to dissolve an image into a concept. This is because something becomes possible in the realm of these schemata which could never be achieved in the realm of those sensuous first impressions [...]&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Whereas every metaphor standing for a sensuous perception is individual fnd unique and is therefore always able to escape classification, the great edifice of concepts exhibits the rigid regularity of a Roman <i>columbarium</i>, while logic breathes out that air of severity and coolness which is peculiar to mathematics. Anyone who has been touched by that cool breath will scarcely believe that concepts too, which are as bony and eight cornered as a dice and just as capable of being shifted around, are only the left-over <i>residue of a metaphor</i>, and that the illusion produced by the artistic translation of a nervous stimulus into images is, if not the mother, then at least the grandmother of each and every concept.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
	
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
By these standards the human being is an architectural genius who is far superior to the bee; the latter builds with wax which she gathers from nature, whereas the human being builds with the far more delicate material ofconcepts which he must first manufacture from himself. In this he is to be much admired — but just not for his impulse to truth, to the pure cognition of things. If someone hides something behind a bush, looks for it in the same place and then finds it there, his seeking and finding is nothing much to boast about; but this is exactly how things are as far as the seeking and finding of “truth” within the territory of reason is concerned. If I create the definition of a mammal and then, having inspected a camel, declare, “behold, a mammal”, then a truth has certainly been brought to light, but it is of limited value, by which I mean that it is anthropomorphic through and through and contains not a single point which could be said to be “true in itself”, really and in a generally valid sense, regardless of mankind.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>
	
<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
He even has to make an effort to admit to himself that insects or birds perceive a quite different world from that of human beings, and that the question as to which of these two perceptions of the world is the more correct is quite meaningless, since this would require them to be measured by the criterion of the <i>correct perception</i>, i.e. by a <i>non-existent</i> criterion. But generally it seems to me that the correct perception —which would mean the full and adequate expression of an object in the subject— is something contradictory and impossible; for between two absolutely different spheres, such as subject and object are, there is no causality, no correctness, no expression, but at most an <i>aesthetic</i> way of relating, by which I mean an allusive transference, a stammering translation into a quite different language. For which purpose a middle sphere and mediating force is certainly required which can freely invent and freely create poetry. The word appearance (<i>Erscheinung</i>) contains many seductions, and for this reason I avoid using it as far as possible; for it is not true that the essence of things appears in the empirical world. A painter who has no hands and who wished to express in song the image hovering before him will still reveal more through this substitution of one sphere for another than the empirical world betrays of the essence of things. Even the relation of a nervous stimulus to the image produced thereby is inherently not a necessary relationship; but when that same image has been produced millions of times and has been passed down through many generations of humanity, indeed eventually appears in the whole of humanity as a consequence of the same occasion, it finally acquires the same significance for all human beings, as if it were the only necessary image and as if that relation of the original nervous stimulus to the image produced were a relation of strict causality — in exactly the same way as a dream, if repeated eternally, would be felt and judged entirely as reality. But the fact that a metaphor becomes hard and rigid is absolutely no guarantee of the necessity and exclusive justification of that metaphor.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
[...] if each of us still had a different kind of sensuous perception, if we ourselves could only perceive things as, variously, a bird, a worm, or a plant does, or if one of us were to see a stimulus as red, a second person were to see the same stimulus as blue, while a third were even to hear it as a sound, nobody would ever speak of nature as something conforming to laws [...]&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Originally, as we have seen, it is <i>language</i> which works on building the edifice of concepts; later it is <i>science</i>. Just as the bee simultaneously builds the cells of its comb and fills them with honey, so science works unceasingly at that great <i>columbarium</i> of concepts, the burial site of perceptions, builds ever-new, ever-higher tiers, supports, cleans, renews the old cells, and strives above all to fill that framework which towers up to vast heights, and to fit into it in an orderly way the whole empirical world, i.e. the anthropomorphic world.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
The intellect, that master of pretence, is free and absolved of its usual slavery for as long as it can deceive without <i>doing harm</i>, and it celebrates its Saturnalian festivals when it does so; at no time is it richer, more luxuriant, more proud, skilful, and bold. Full of creative contentment, it jumbles up metaphors and shifts the boundary stones of abstraction, describing a river, for example, as a moving road that carries men to destinations to which they normally walk.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
There are epochs in which the man of reason and the man of intuition stand side by side, the one fearful of intuition, the other filled with scorn for abstraction, the latter as unreasonable as the former is unartistic. They both desire to rule over life; the one by his knowledge of how to cope with the chief calamities of life by providing for the future, by prudence and regularity, the other by being an “exuberant hero” who does not see those calamities and who only acknowledges life as real when it is disguised as beauty and appearance.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<p>
[...]
</p>
<p>
Whereas the man who is guided by concepts and abstractions only succeeds thereby in warding off misfortune, is unable to compel the abstractions themselves to yield him happiness, and strives merely to be as free as possible of pain, the man of intuition, standing in the midst of a culture, reaps directly from his intuitions not just protection from harm but also a constant stream of brightness, a lightening of the spirit, redemption, and release. Of course, <i>when</i> he suffers, he suffers more severely; indeed he suffers more frequently because he does not know how to learn from experience and keeps on falling into the very same trap time after time. When he is suffering he is just as unreasonable as he is when happy, he shouts out loudly and knows no solace. How differently the same misfortune is endured by the stoic who has learned from experience and who governs himself by means of concepts! This man, who otherwise seeks only honesty, truth, freedom from illusions, and protection from the onslaughts of things which might distract him, now performs, in the midst of misfortune, a masterpiece of pretence, just as the other did in the midst of happiness: he does not wear a twitching, mobile, human face, but rather a mask, as it were, with its features in dignified equilibrium; he does not shout, nor does he even change his tone of voice. If a veritable storm-cloud empties itself on his head, he wraps himself in his cloak and slowly walks away from under it.&nbsp;<a href="#otal" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<p>
In every age the wisest have passed the identical judgement on life: <i>it is worthless</i>... Everywhere and always their mouths have uttered the same sound — a sound full of doubt, full of melancholy, full of weariness with life, full of opposition to life. Even Socrates said as he died: “To live — that means to be a long time sick: I owe a cock to the saviour Asclepius”. Even Socrates had had enough of it. What does that <i>prove</i>? What does it <i>point to</i>? Formerly one would have said (oh, and did say, and loudly enough, and our pessimists most of all!): “Here at any rate there must be something true! The <i>consensus sapientium</i> is proof of truth.”
</p>
<p>
[...]
</p>
<p>
That <i>consensus sapientium</i> —I saw more and more clearly— proves least of all that they were right about what they were in accord over: it proves rather that they themselves, these wisest men, were in some way in <i>physiological</i> accord since they stood —<i>had</i> to stand— in the same negative relation to life. Judgements, value judgements concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms [...]&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

You ask me about the idiosyncrasies of philosophers? There is their lack of historical sense, their hatred of even the idea of becoming, their Egyptianism. They think they are doing a thing <i>honour</i> when they dehistoricize it, <i>sub specie aeterni</i> — when they make a mummy of it.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

I set apart with high reverence the name of Heraclitus. When the rest of the philosopher crowd rejected the evidence of the senses because these showed plurality and change, he rejected their evidence because they showed things as if they possessed duration and unity. Heraclitus too was unjust to the senses, which lie neither in the way the Eleatics believe nor as he believed — they do not lie at all. It is what we <i>make</i> of their evidence that first introduces a lie into it [...]&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<p>
We possess scientific knowledge today to precisely the extent that we have decided to <i>accept</i> the evidence of the senses — to the extent that we have learned to sharpen and arm them and to think them through to their conclusions.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

Language belongs in its origin to the age of the most rudimentary form of psychology: we find ourselves in the midst of a rude fetishism when we call to mind the basic presuppositions of the metaphysics of language — which is to say, of <i>reason</i>. It is <i>this</i> which sees everywhere deed and doer; this which believes in will as cause in general; this which believes in the “ego”, in the ego as being, in the ego as substance, and which <i>projects</i> its belief in the ego-substance on to all things — only thus does it <i>create</i> the concept “thing”. Being is everywhere thought in, <i>foisted on</i>, as cause; it is only from the conception “ego” that there follows, derivatively, the concept “being”. At the beginning stands the great fateful error that the will is something which <i>produces an effect</i> — that will is a faculty. Today we know it is merely a word. Very much later, in a world a thousand times more enlightened, the <i>security</i>, the subjective <i>certainty</i> with which the categories of reason could be employed came all of a sudden into philosophers' heads: they concluded that these could not have originated in the empirical world — indeed, the entire empirical world was incompatible with them. <i>Where then do they originate?</i> And in India as in Greece they committed the same blunder: “We must once have dwelt in a higher world” —instead of <i>in a very much lower one</i>, which would have been the truth! — “we must have been divine, <i>for</i> we possess reason!”&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<p>
There is a time with all passions when they are merely fatalities, when they drag their victim down with the weight of their folly — and a later, very much later time when they are wedded with the spirit, when they are “spiritualized”. Formerly one made war on passion itself on account of the folly inherent in it: one conspired for its extermination — all the old moral monsters are unanimous that “<i>il faut tuer les passions</i>”.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
The Church combats the passions with excision in every sense of the word: its practice, its “cure” is <i>castration</i>. It never asks: “How can one spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire?”

Radical hostility, mortal hostility towards sensuality is always a thought-provoking symptom: it justifies making certain conjectures as to the general condition of one who is excessive in this respect.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

For a condemnation of life by the living is after all no more than the symptom of a certain kind of life: the question whether the condemnation is just or unjust has not been raised at all. One would have to be situated <i>outside</i> life, and on the other hand to know it as thoroughly as any, as many, as all who have experienced it, to be permitted to touch on the problem of the <i>value</i> of life at all: sufficient reason for understanding that this problem is for us an inaccessible problem. When we speak of values we do so under the inspiration and from the perspective of life [...]&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<i>The error of confusing cause and consequence</i>. There is no more dangerous error than that of <i>mistaking the consequence for the cause</i>: I call it reason's intrinsic form of corruption. None the less, this error is among the most ancient and most recent habits of mankind: it is even sanctified among us, it bears the names “religion” and “morality”. <i>Every</i> proposition formulated by religion and morality contains it; priests and moral legislators are the authors of this corruption of reason. I adduce an example. Everyone knows the book of the celebrated Cornaro in which he recommends his meagre diet as a recipe for a long and happy life — a virtuous one, too. Few books have been so widely read; even now many thousands of copies are printed in England every year. I do not doubt that hardly any book (the Bible rightly excepted) has done so much harm, has shortened so many lives, as this curiosity, which was so well meant. The reason: mistaking the consequence for the cause. The worthy Italian saw in his diet the <i>cause</i> of his long life: while the prerequisite of long life, an extraordinarily slow metabolism, a small consumption, was the cause of his meagre diet. He was not free to eat much <i>or</i> little as he chose, his frugality was <i>not</i> an act of “free will”: he became ill when he ate more. But if one is not a bony fellow of this sort one does not merely do well, one positively needs to eat <i>properly</i>. A scholar of <i>our</i> day, with his rapid consumption of nervous energy, would kill himself with Cornaro's regimen.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
<i>The error of a false causality</i>. We have always believed we know what a cause is: but whence did we derive our knowledge, more precisely our belief we possessed this knowledge? From the realm of the celebrated “inner facts”, none of which has up till now been shown to be factual. We believed ourselves to be causal agents in the act of willing; we at least thought we were there <i>catching causality in the act</i>. It was likewise never doubted that all the <i>antecedentia</i> of an action, its causes, were to be sought in the consciousness and could be discovered there if one sought them — as “motives”: for otherwise one would not have been <i>free</i> to perform it, <i>responsible</i> for it. Finally, who would have disputed that a thought is caused? that the ego causes the thought? Of these three “inner facts” through which causality seemed to be guaranteed the first and most convincing was that of <i>will as cause</i>; the conception of a consciousness (“mind”) as cause and later still that of the ego (the “subject”) as cause are merely after-products after causality had, on the basis of will, been firmly established as a given fact, as <i>empiricism</i>. Meanwhile, we have thought better. Today we do not believe a word of it. The “inner world” is full of phantoms and false lights: the will is one of them. The will no longer moves anything, consequently no longer explains anything — it merely accompanies events, it can also be absent. The so-called “motive”: another error. Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, an accompaniment to an act, which conceals rather than exposes the <i>antecedentia</i> of the act. And as for the ego! It has become a fable, a fiction, a play on words: it has ttotily ceased to think, to feel and to will! What follows from this? There are no spiritual causes at all! The whole of the alleged empiricism which affirmed them has gone to the devil! <i>That</i> is what follows! And we had made a nice misuse of that “empiricism”, we had <i>created</i> the world on the basis of it as a world of causes, as a world of will, as a world of spirit. The oldest and longest-lived psychology was at work here — indeed it has done nothing else: every event was to it an action, every action the effect of a will, the world became for it a multiplicity of agents, an agent (“subject”) foisted itself upon every event. Man projected his three “inner facts”, that in which he believed more firmly than in anything else, will, spirit, ego, outside himself — he derived the concept “being” only from the concept “ego”, he posited “things” as possessing being according to his own image, according to his concept of the ego as cause. No wonder he later always discovered in things only <i>that which he had put into them!</i> The thing itself, to say it again, the concept “thing” is merely a reflection of the belief in the ego as cause.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

The ideas <i>engendered</i> by a certain condition have been misunderstood as the cause of that condition. We do just the same thing, in fact, when we are awake. Most of our general feelings —every sort of restraint, pressure, tension, explosion in the play and counter-play of our organs, likewise and especially the condition of the <i>nervus sympathicus</i>— excite our cause-creating drive: we want to have a <i>reason</i> for feeling <i>as we do</i> — for feeling well or for feeling ill. It never suffices us simply to establish the mere fact <i>that</i> we feel as we do: we acknowledge this fact —become <i>conscious</i> of it— only <i>when</i> we have furnished it with a motivation of some kind. The memory, which in such a case becomes active without our being aware of it, calls up earlier states of a similar kind and the causal interpretations which have grown out of them — <i>not</i> their causality. To be sure, the belief that these ideas, the accompanying occurrences in the consciousness, were causes is also brought up by the memory. Thus there arises an <i>habituation</i> to a certain causal interpretation which in truth obstructs and even prohibits an <i>investigation</i> of the cause.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<i>The error of free will</i>.

The whole of the old-style psychology, the psychology of will, has as its precondition the desire of its authors, the priests at the head of the ancient communities, to create for themselves a <i>right</i> to ordain punishments — or their desire to create for God a right to do so. Men were thought of as “free” so that they could become <i>guilty</i>: consequently, every action <i>had</i> to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action as lying in the consciousness (whereby the most <i>fundamental</i> falsification <i>in psychologicis</i> was made into the very principle of psychology). Today, when we have started to move in the <i>reverse</i> direction, when we immoralists especially are trying with all our might to remove the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment from the world and to purge psychology, history, nature, the social institutions and sanctions of them, there is in our eyes no more radical opposition than that of the theologians, who continue to infect the innocence of becoming with “punishment” and “guilt” by means of the concept of the “moral world-order”. Christianity is a hangman's metaphysics.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves <i>beyond</i> good and evil — that they have the illusion of moral judgement <i>beneath</i> them. This demand follows from an insight first formulated by me: <i>that there are no moral facts whatever</i>. Moral judgement has this in common with religious judgement that it believes in realities which do not exist. Morality is only an interpretation of certain phenomena, more precisely a <i>mis</i>interpretation.&nbsp;<a href="#toti" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
