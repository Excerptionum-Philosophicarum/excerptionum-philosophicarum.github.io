Estos son pasajes de la traducción al inglés hecha por R. J. Hollingdale en 1968. Se muestran simplemente en el orden de aparición en el texto. Considerando que este libro contiene básicamente un compendio de mucho del pensamiento principal de Nietzsche, es ampliamente recomendado como una primera lectura. Fue uno de los últimos que escribió.

To stay cheerful when involved in a gloomy and exceedingly responsible business is no inconsiderable art: yet what could be more necessary than cheerfulness? Nothing succeeds in which high spirits play no part. Only excess of strength is proof of strength. <i>A revaluation of all values</i>, this question-mark so black, so huge it casts a shadow over him who sets it up — such a destiny of a task compels one every instant to run out into the sunshine so as to shake off a seriousness grown all too oppressive. Every expedient for doing so is justified, every “occasion” a joyful occasion.

That <i>consensus sapientium</i> —I saw more and more clearly— proves least of all that they were right about what they were in accord over: it proves rather that they themselves, these wisest men, were in some way in physiological accord since they stood —had to stand— in the same negative relation to life. Judgements, value judgements concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms [...]

I seek to understand out of what idiosyncrasy that Socratic equation reason = virtue = happiness derives: that bizarrest of equations and one which has in particular all the instincts of the older Hellenes against it.

<p>
You ask me about the idiosyncrasies of philosophers?… There is their lack of historical sense, their hatred of even the idea of becoming, their Egyptianism. They think they are doing a thing honour when they dehistoricize it, <i>sub specie aeterni</i> — when they make a mummy of it.

I set apart with high reverence the name of Heraclitus. When the rest of the philosopher crowd rejected the evidence of the senses because these showed plurality and change, he rejected their evidence because they showed things as if they possessed duration and unity. Heraclitus too was unjust to the senses, which lie neither in the way the Eleatics believe nor as he believed — they do not lie at all. It is what we <i>make</i> of their evidence that first introduces a lie into it [...]

We possess scientific knowledge today to precisely the extent that we have decided to accept the evidence of the senses — to the extent that we have learned to sharpen and arm them and to think them through to their conclusions.

Language belongs in its origin to the age of the most rudimentary form of psychology: we find ourselves in the midst of a rude fetishism when we call to mind the basic presuppositions of the metaphysics of language — which is to say, of 
<i>reason</i>. It is <i>this</i> which sees everywhere deed and doer; this which believes in will as cause in general; this which believes in the “ego”, in the ego as being, in the ego as substance, and which <i>projects</i> its belief in the ego-substance on to all things — only thus does it <i>create</i> the concept “thing”... Being is everywhere thought in, <i>foisted on</i>, as cause; it is only from the conception “ego” that there follows, derivatively, the concept “being”... At the beginning stands the great fateful error that the will is something which <i>produces an effect</i> — that will is a <i>faculty</i>... Today we know it is merely a word... Very much later, in a world a thousand times more enlightened, the <i>security</i>, the subjective <i>certainty</i> with which the categories of reason could be employed came all of a sudden into philosophers' heads: they concluded that these could not have originated in the empirical world — indeed, the entire empirical world was incompatible with them. <i>Where then do they originate?</i> And in India as in Greece they committed the same blunder: “We must once have dwelt in a higher world” —instead of <i>in a very much lower one</i>, which would have been the truth! — “we must have been divine, <i>for</i> we possess reason!”

There is a time with all passions when they are merely fatalities, when they drag their victim down with the weight of their folly – and a later, very much later time when they are wedded with the spirit, when they are “spiritualized”. Formerly one made war on passion itself on account of the folly inherent in it: one conspired for its extermination – all the old moral monsters are unanimous that “<i>il faut tuer les passions</i>”.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The Church combats the passions with excision in every sense of the word: its practice, its “cure” is castration. It never asks: “How can one spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire?”

Radical hostility, mortal hostility towards sensuality is always a thought-provoking symptom: it justifies making certain conjectures as to the general condition of one who is excessive in this respect.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The spiritualization of sensuality is called <i>love</i>: it is a great triumph over Christianity. A further triumph is our spiritualization of <i>enmity</i>. It consists in profoundly grasping the value of having enemies [...] only in opposition does it feel itself necessary, only in opposition does it <i>become</i> necessary. We adopt the same attitude towards the “enemy within”: there too we have spiritualized enmity, there too we have grasped its <i>value</i>. One is <i>fruitful</i> only at the cost of being rich in contradictions [...]

I formulate a principle. All naturalism in morality, that is all healthy morality, is dominated by an instinct of life — some commandment of life is fulfilled through a certain canon of “shall” and “shall not”, some hindrance and hostile element on life's road is thereby removed. Anti-natural morality, that is virtually every morality that has hitherto been taught, reverenced and preached, turns on the contrary precisely against the instincts of life [...]

<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
For a condemnation of life by the living is after all no more than the symptom of a certain kind of life [...]

<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
Let us consider finally what naïvety it is to say “man ought to be thus and thus!” Reality shows us an enchanting wealth of types, the luxuriance of a prodigal play and change of forms: and does some pitiful journeyman moralist say at the sight of it: “No! Man ought to be different”?
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
In so far as morality condemns as morality and not with regard to the aims and objects of life, it is a specific error with which one should show no sympathy, an idiosyncrasy of the degenerate which has caused an unspeakable amount of harm!
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
<i>The error of confusing cause and consequence</i>. There is no more dangerous error than that of <i>mistaking the consequence for the cause</i>: I call it reason's intrinsic form of corruption. None the less, this error is among the most ancient and most recent habits of mankind: it is even sanctified among us, it bears the names “religion” and “morality”. <i>Every</i> proposition formulated by religion and morality contains it; priests and moral legislators are the authors of this corruption of reason. I adduce an example. Everyone knows the book of the celebrated Cornaro in which he recommends his meagre diet as a recipe for a long and happy life — a virtuous one, too. Few books have been so widely read; even now many thousands of copies are printed in England every year. I do not doubt that hardly any book (the Bible rightly excepted) has done so much harm, has shortened so many lives, as this curiosity, which was so well meant. The reason: mistaking the consequence for the cause. The worthy Italian saw in his diet the <i>cause</i> of his long life: while the prerequisite of long life, an extraordinarily slow metabolism, a small consumption, was the cause of his meagre diet. He was not free to eat much <i>or</i> little as he chose, his frugality was <i>not</i> an act of “free will”: he became ill when he ate more.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The most general formula at the basis of every religion and morality is: “Do this and this, refrain from this and this — and you will be happy! Otherwise...” Every morality, every religion <i>is</i> this imperative — I call it the great original sin of reason, <i>immortal unreason</i>. In my mouth this formula is converted into its reverse —  <i>first</i> example of my “revaluation of all values”: a well-constituted human being, a “happy one”, <i>must</i> perform certain actions and instinctively shrinks from other actions, he transports the order of which he is the physiological representative into his relations with other human beings and with things. In a formula: his virtue is the <i>consequence</i> of his happiness...
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
<i>The error of a false causality</i>. We have always believed we know what a cause is: but whence did we derive our knowledge, more precisely our belief we possessed this knowledge? From the realm of the celebrated “inner facts”, none of which has up till now been shown to be factual. We believed ourselves to be causal agents in the act of willing; we at least thought we were there <i>catching causality in the act</i>. It was likewise never doubted that all the <i>antecedentia</i> of an action, its causes, were to be sought in the consciousness and could be discovered there if one sought them — as “motives”: for otherwise one would not have been <i>free</i> to perform it, <i>responsible</i> for it. Finally, who would have disputed that a thought is caused? that the ego causes the thought?... Of these three “inner facts” through which causality seemed to be guaranteed the first and most convincing was that of <i>will as cause</i>; the conception of a consciousness (“mind”) as cause and later still that of the ego (the “subject”) as cause are merely after-products after causality had, on the basis of will, been firmly established as a given fact, as <i>empiricism</i>... Meanwhile, we have thought better. Today we do not believe a word of it. The “inner world” is full of phantoms and false lights: the will is one of them. The will no longer moves anything, consequently no longer explains anything — it merely accompanies events, it can also be absent. The so-called “motive”: another error. Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, an accompaniment to an act, which conceals rather than exposes the <i>antecedentia</i> of the act.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
And as for the ego! It has become a fable, a fiction, a play on words: it has totally ceased to think, to feel and to will!... What follows from this? There are no spiritual causes at all! The whole of the alleged empiricism which affirmed them has gone to the devil! <i>That</i> is what follows! And we had made a nice misuse of that “empiricism”, we had <i>created</i> the world on the basis of it as a world of causes, as a world of will, as a world of spirit. The oldest and longest-lived psychology was at work here — indeed it has done nothing else: every event was to it an action, every action the effect of a will, the world became for it a multiplicity of agents, an agent (“subject”) foisted itself upon every event. Man projected his three “inner facts”, that in which he believed more firmly than in anything else, will, spirit, ego, outside himself — he derived the concept “being” only from the concept “ego”, he posited “things” as possessing being according to his own image, according to his concept of the ego as cause. No wonder he later always discovered in things only <i>that which he had put into them!</i> The thing itself, to say it again, the concept “thing” is merely a reflection of the belief in the ego as cause...
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The ideas <i>engendered</i> by a certain condition have been misunderstood as the cause of that condition. We do just the same thing, in fact, when we are awake. Most of our general feelings —every sort of restraint, pressure, tension, explosion in the play and counter-play of our organs, likewise and especially the condition of the <i>nervus sympathicus</i>— excite our cause-creating drive: we want to have a <i>reason</i> for feeling <i>as we do</i> — for feeling well or for feeling ill. It never suffices us simply to establish the mere fact <i>that</i> we feel as we do: we acknowledge this fact —become <i>conscious</i> of it— only <i>when</i> we have furnished it with a motivation of some kind. The memory, which in such a case becomes active without our being aware of it, calls up earlier states of a similar kind and the causal interpretations which have grown out of them — <i>not</i> their causality. To be sure, the belief that these ideas, the accompanying occurrences in the consciousness, were causes is also brought up by the memory. Thus there arises an <i>habituation</i> to a certain causal interpretation which in truth obstructs and even prohibits an <i>investigation</i> of the cause.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The whole of the old-style psychology, the psychology of will, has as its precondition the desire of its authors, the priests at the head of the ancient communities, to create for themselves a <i>right</i> to ordain punishments — or their desire to create for God a right to do so... Men were thought of as “free” so that they could become <i>guilty</i>: consequently, every action <i>had</i> to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action as lying in the consciousness (whereby the most <i>fundamental</i> falsification <i>in psychologicis</i> was made into the very principle of psychology)... Today, when we have started to move in the <i>reverse</i> direction, when we immoralists especially are trying with all our might to remove the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment from the world and to purge psychology, history, nature, the social institutions and sanctions of them, there is in our eyes no more radical opposition than that of the theologians, who continue to infect the innocence of becoming with “punishment” and “guiltn by means of the concept of the “moral world-order”. Christianity is a hangman's metaphysics...
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves <i>beyond</i> good and evil — that they have the illusion of moral judgement <i>beneath</i> them. This demand follows from an insight first formulated by me: <i>that there are no moral facts whatever</i>. Moral judgement has this in common with religious judgement that it believes in realities which do not exist. Morality is only an interpretation of certain phenomena, more precisely a <i>mis</i>interpretation.

<h1><a href="#tac">The Anti-Christ (1888)</a></h1>
<p>
Estos son pasajes de la traducción al inglés hecha por R. J. Hollingdale en 1968. Se muestran simplemente en el orden de aparición en el texto. En el caso de este libro me enfoco en las partes sobre el budismo, porque es lo que más me interesa.

<p>
With my condemnation of Christianity, I should not like to have wronged a kindred religion which even preponderates in the number of its believers: <i>Buddhism</i>. They belong together as nihilistic religions —they are <i>décadence</i> religions— but they are distinguished from one another in the most remarkable way. The critic of Christianity is profoundly grateful to Indian scholars that one is now able to <i>compare</i> these two religions. Buddhism is a hundred times more realistic than Christianity — it has the heritage of a cool and objective posing of problems in its composition, it arrives <i>after</i> a philosophical movement lasting hundreds of years; the concept “God” is already abolished by the time it arrives. Buddhism is the only really <i>positivistic</i> religion history has to show us, even in its epistemology (a strict phenomenalism), it no longer speaks of “the struggle against <i>sin</i>” but, quite in accordance with actuality, “the struggle against <i>suffering</i>”. It already has —and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity— the self-deception of moral concepts behind it — it stands, in my language, <i>beyond</i> good and evil.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The <i>two</i> physiological facts upon which it rests and on which it fixes its eyes are: <i>firstly</i> an excessive excitability of sensibility which expresses itself as a refined capacity for pain, <i>then</i> an over-intellectuality, a too great preoccupation with concepts and logical procedures under which the personal instinct has sustained harm to the advantage of the “impersonal” (both of them conditions which at any rate some of my readers, the objective ones, will know from experience, as I do). On the basis of these physiological conditions a state of <i>depression</i> has arisen: against this depression Buddha takes hygienic measures. He opposes it with life in the open air, the wandering life; with moderation and fastidiousness as regards food; with caution towards all emotions which produce gall, which heat the blood; <i>no</i> anxiety, either for oneself or for others. He demands ideas which produce repose or cheerfulness — he devises means for disaccustoming oneself to others. He understands benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
For this reason too he demands no struggle against those who think differently; his teaching resists nothing <i>more</i> than it resists the feeling of revengefulness, of antipathy, of <i>ressentiment</i> (“enmity is not ended by enmity”: the moving refrain of the whole of Buddhism...). And quite rightly: it is precisely these emotions which would be thoroughly <i>unhealthy</i> with regard to the main dietetic objective. The spiritual weariness he discovered and which expressed itself as an excessive “objectivity” (that is to say weakening of individual interest, loss of centre of gravity, of “egoism”), he combated by directing even the spiritual interests back to the individual <i>person</i>. In the teaching of Buddha egoism becomes a duty: the “one thing needful”, the “how can <i>you</i> get rid of suffering” regulates and circumscribes the entire spiritual diet [...]
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
The precondition for Buddhism is a very mild climate, very gentle and liberal customs, no militarism; and that it is the higher and even learned classes in which the movement has its home. The supreme goal is cheerfulness, stillness, absence of desire, and this goal is achieved. Buddhism is not a religion in which one merely aspires after perfection: perfection is the normal case.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
A certain sense of cruelty towards oneself and others is Christian; hatred of those who think differently; the will to persecute.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
Here discontentedness with oneself, suffering from oneself is not, as it is with the Buddhists, an immoderate excitability and capacity for pain, but on the contrary an overwhelming desire to do harm, to discharge an inner tension in hostile actions and ideas.
</p>
<h2 style="color:var(--accent);">&sect;</h2>
<p>
It no longer needs to make its suffering and capacity for pain decent to itself by interpreting it as sin — it merely says what it feels: “I suffer”. To the barbarian, on the contrary, suffering in itself is not decent: he first requires it to be interpreted before he will admit to himself that he suffers [...]
