<h1><a href="#noesis-collection">Noesis Collection</a></h1>
<p>
The <i>Noesis Collection</i> is comprised of haikus on various philosophical themes, including references to particular historical philosophers. In a strict sense, however, especially in the thematic aspect, these poems are not traditional Japanese haiku, nor are they precisely <i>senryū</i>, either. Nonetheless, I like adhering to the typical structure, concerning (1) syllabic metrics, and (2) seeking to pivot, as inspired by the disjuncture produced in Japanese via the 切れ字 (<i>kireji</i>, ‘cutting word’). Very importantly, in the spirit of this kind of poetry, I enjoy practicing its density in brevity, together with an exploration of intuition, connected with the meditative aspect it tends to have. For pragmatism, therefore, whenever I use the term “haiku” I mean it <i>sensu lato</i>, mostly in reference to my own writings. For greater accuracy, I can suggest expressions like “haikuesque” or “haiku-like” instead of “haiku”, but the latter is usually the better-known in the Occidental world.

<p class="strophe">
Pulsations of spontaneous semiotic assertions<br>
are galvanized by intuitive qualia translations.<br>
Organic convexities kiss data input elongations,<br>
as the many correlates that hide betwixt travelled corrugations<br>
are loved by the firstborn of the leptons.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
Rigorous seekings for lexical alchemy<br>
are concurrent with flowing creative leniency.<br>

<p class="strophe">
Within a hospitable conglomerated ground,<br>
many epistemators concentrate on sowing endlessly.<br>
We ask if the waters are so dense all year round.<br>
Is the prognosis for the harvesters to abundantly collect?
</p>
<p class="strophe">
That is what the chronically dehydrated seem to expect.<br>
Not all are wishing to behave like a monolith, certainly.<br>
We remember the crops for which we ought not to interject,<br>
while others keep attempting to pull them out by brute force.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
Do the self-proclaimed rigorous do so without remorse?<br>
Perhaps they believe they are and they engage in said conduct.<br>
We view it as pollution by the disturgent at a physiological source.<br>
And when the irrigation gets colloidal, little absorption can happen.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
The good epistemators are wise enough to let the fruit ripen.<br>
In fact, such wisdom doesn't necessitate a card-holding member.<br>
We seek a club that would prefer no members to enlighten,<br>
but who heal the ignorance of what a concrete flower requires not to spoil.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
Remember what happens when it rains too much on too-arid soil?<br>
Not all forget that not every word can be appropriate for any ear.<br>
We apologize, pure politeness, for we will need to be your foil,<br>
as we wince at hearing you proclaim contemplation without interest.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
The investigators later verified we were reading a palimpsest.<br>
Yes, we still guard ourselves against pernicious fictions of old,<br>
but not due to their age: it's the danger of tarnishing the brightest,<br>
if by light we mean what emanates from an evershifting flame.
</p>
<p class="strophe">
And so many excesses were measured, peoples of not-culture to blame.<br>
Pseudo-neutral homogeneity for everyone: Procustes keeps a job.<br>
We know fire can be used for firebreaks, often the only way in a desert game.<br>
To assume ideal states as basis for distinctions, or to distinguish based on structural differences?

understanding what's essential,<br>
essential as prerequisite,<br>

<h1><a href="#light-coffee-haibun">Light Coffee <i>Haibun</i></a></h1>
<p>
I make good coffee, if I may say so myself. Some people say it's too strong for them. But not these players here. Mach sits at a coffee table, which is located in Lenin's studio. A nice, small, circular table with enough space for a chessboard and some cups of coffee, in full view of me. Lenin is there, playing not so much against him as with him. They're experiencing coffee and chess together because I persuaded them to do so, to join in. Lenin is beginning to learn, to accept, perhaps, that Mach is not an idealist. Mach is opposed to being considered an idealist, although he affirms that it can be understandable to regard him as such because of his previous influences. But he's no Berkeley and he doesn't want to be labeled thus. But Lenin has looked and found there is enough in what Mach says that is peculiarly similar, much too similar, to the bishop. At the same time, Lenin doesn't quite understand what can be observed as a more important aspect of Mach.

Beyond the contact that is inevitably required between photons and eyes, whatever part of them one might need or want to focus, whether retina or optic nerve, or something else, said inevitably required photons do indeed move from one location to another, quantum uncertainty aside, because light does indeed travel at a certain approximately calculable velocity, and therefore we are able to use language to refer to, so to speak —and no, Einstein, our entire lives are not illusions, thank you—, a before and an after said quanta touch photoreceptors, which if doesn't happen, we don't see. Could those photons be our experiences before we can experience them? That is to say, prior contact and more immediately to the point, we don't have the associated sensations in absence of a kind of haptic engagement. Also, it's not like we're permanently superimposed with, at, over, under, on, whatever, said quanta. They move. So there is direct contact with the external world, where “external” simply means that which is discernible from “oneself” —ego aside, or perhaps not, thank you Nietzsche—, that which is not part of what I is <i>qua</i> biological organism, physiological juncture, as I like to call it, which involves eyes hapticating so that I sees. Afterwards, what is experience is sense-mediated, which looks redundantly similar to saying that after that happens one is already experiencing at least one sensation: vision, eyesight.
</p>
<p>
<i>And am I thinking<br>
that I'm sure what thinking is?<br>
State comparison.</i>
</p>
<p>
I don't suppose this is supposed to be illuminating, necessarily, but I do enjoy caffeine and sucrose —separatedly, I must clarify, as I don't commit the heresy of adding sugar to black coffee— and I'm hereby stimulated. Afterwards, eyes and optic nerves process, interpret, do something already before the associated electric impulses travel to the encephalon, to the brain, where the processing proceeds. Yes, a lot of, or perchance most of everything and anything a human can experience, is mediated by sensations, which is to say, again redundantly, that almost all experiences are sensations, whatever names we give them. It looks similar to reading the question Saussureanly, except concerning senses and not signs. I think he might value my words, but he hasn't arrived yet. I should make more coffee. Sometimes I'm not sure whether to view psychic phenomena as a kind of sensations, but then if I see that there are sensory neurons as differentiated from other, non-sensory neurons, then that sheds light on the matter.
</p>
<p>
<i>Ionic fluxes<br>
traverse organic cables<br>
neighbourhood effect.</i>
</p>
<p>
Machy here agrees with what I think, except with, as far as I know, the part about there being direct contact, pre-sensory, as a requisite for sensory experience, before experiencing sensations, for he disregards anything as being pre-sensory, as far as I know, which is, again redundantly —my eyebrows are now raised— curiously reminiscent, suspiciously similar, to subjective idealism. Lenny here agrees with what I think, or I think so, and I don't see why he wouldn't, unless he can be foolish enough to deny the importance of knowing more about our sensations insofar we couldn't experience anything without them in the first instance. Experience is sensory — ah, but I unmetathought for a moment. My mistake, and how blind of me. Regardless, if Lenny thinks that's also being an idealist, then he does need eyeglasses. Machy doesn't need them but he's still wearing them, also the prescription is insane, and they're excessive sunglasses foisted upon him by a bishop.
</p>
<p>
<i>Diagonal strikes<br>
firm material towers<br>
can be flexible.</i>
</p>
<p>
But I'm also worried about Machy, because I think he's capable of positing that the photons in question also are, somehow, are, as a radical existential determination, our experiences too —if you're able to make photons using only your nervous system as raw matter, do let me know—, in the sense of and as opposed to positing on the experiences we have of photons, as well as the experiences we have because of photons, thank you Hyperion. Perspectivism is significant, important, fundamental, and it seems to me that both of them misunderstand the matter due to their perspectives. Regardless, the coffee is good. I should know, I made it. I made it for both of them and for myself. Ah, Feyerabend is about to arrive. Now the party will start. I should make more coffee.
