Again I want to make two points: first, that science can stand on its own feet and does not need any help from rationalists, secular humanists, Marxists and similar religious movements; and, secondly, that non-scientific cultures, procedures and assumptions can also stand on their own feet and should be allowed to do so, if this is the wish of their representatives. Science must be protected from ideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be protected from science. This does not mean that scientists cannot profit from a philosophical education and that humanity has not and never will profit from the sciences. However, the profits should not be imposed; they should be examined and freely accepted by the parties of the exchange. In a democracy scientific institutions, research programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected to public control, there must be a separation of state and science just as there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and science should be taught as one view among many and not as the one and only road to truth and reality. There is nothing in the nature of science that excludes such institutional arrangements or shows that they are liable to lead to disaster.

None of the ideas that underlie my argument is new. My interpretation of scientific knowledge, for example, was a triviality for physicists like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr. But the ideas of these great thinkers were distorted beyond recognition by the rodents of neopositivism and the competing rodents of the church of “critical” rationalism.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

Many things have happened since I first published Against Method (AM for short). There have been dramatic political, social and ecological changes. Freedom has increased - but it has brought hunger, insecurity, nationalistic tensions, wars and straightforward murder. World leaders have met to deal with the deterioration of our resources; as is their habit, they have made speeches and signed agreements. The agreements are far from satisfactory; some of them are a sham. However, at least verbally, the environment has become a world-wide concern. Physicians, developmental agents, priests working with the poor and disadvantaged have realized that these people know more about their condition than a belief in the universal excellence of science or organized religion had assumed and they have changed their actions and their ideas accordingly (liberation theology; primary environmental care, etc.). Many intellectuals have adapted what they have learned at universities and special schools to make their knowledge more efficient and more humane.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

In sociology the attention to detail has led to a situation where the problem is no longer why and how “science” changes but how it keeps together. Philosophers, philosophers of biology especially, suspected for some time that there is not one entity “science” with clearly defined principles but that science contains a great variety of (high-level theoretical, phenomenological, experimental) approaches and that even a particular science such as physics is but a scattered collection of subjects (elasticity, hydrodynamics, rheology, thermodynamics, etc., etc.) each one containing contrary tendencies [...]&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

It is clear that the new situation requires a new philosophy and, above all, new terms. Yet some of the foremost researchers in the area are still asking themselves whether a particular piece of research produces a “discovery”, or an “invention”, or to what extent a (temporary) result is “objective”. The problem arose in quantum mechanics; it is also a problem for classical science. Shall we continue using outmoded terms to describe novel insight or would it not be better to start using a new language? And wouldn't poets and journalists be of great help in finding such a language?&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

This book proposes a thesis and draws consequences from it. The thesis is: <i>the events, procedures and results that constitute the sciences have no common structure</i>; there are no elements that occur in every scientific investigation but are missing elsewhere. Concrete developments (such as the overthrow of steady state cosmologies and the discovery of the structure of DNA) have distinct features and we can often explain why and how these features led to success. But not every discovery can be accounted for in the same manner, and procedures that paid off in the past may create havoc when imposed on the future. Successful research does not obey general standards; it relies now on one trick, now on another; the moves that advance it and the standards that define what counts as an advance are not always known to the movers. Far-reaching changes of outlook, such as the so-called “Copernican Revolution” or the “Darwinian Revolution”, affect different areas of research in different ways and receive different impulses from them. A theory of science that devises standards and structural elements for <i>all</i> scientific activities and authorizes them by reference to “Reason” or “Rationality” may impress outsiders — but it is much too crude an instrument for the people on the spot, that is, for scientists facing some concrete research problem.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
But if scientific achievements can be judged only after the event and if there is no abstract way of ensuring success beforehand, then there exists no special way of weighing scientific promises either — scientists are no better off than anybody else in these matters, they only know more details. This means that <i>the public can participate in the discussion without disturbing existing roads to success</i> (there are no such roads). In cases where the scientists' work affects the public it even <i>should</i> participate: first, because it is a concerned party (many scientific decisions affect public life); secondly, because such participation is the best scientific education the public can get - a full democratization of science (which includes the protection of minorities such as scientists) is not in conflict with science. It is in conflict with a philosophy, often called “Rationalism”, that uses a frozen image of science to terrorize people unfamiliar with its practice.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
