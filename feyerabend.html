<p>
Again I want to make two points: first, that science can stand on its own feet and does not need any help from rationalists, secular humanists, Marxists and similar religious movements; and, secondly, that non-scientific cultures, procedures and assumptions can also stand on their own feet and should be allowed to do so, if this is the wish of their representatives. Science must be protected from ideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be protected from science. This does not mean that scientists cannot profit from a philosophical education and that humanity has not and never will profit from the sciences. However, the profits should not be imposed; they should be examined and freely accepted by the parties of the exchange. In a democracy scientific institutions, research programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected to public control, there must be a separation of state and science just as there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and science should be taught as one view among many and not as the one and only road to truth and reality. There is nothing in the nature of science that excludes such institutional arrangements or shows that they are liable to lead to disaster.
</p>
<p>
None of the ideas that underlie my argument is new. My interpretation of scientific knowledge, for example, was a triviality for physicists like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr. But the ideas of these great thinkers were distorted beyond recognition by the rodents of neopositivism and the competing rodents of the church of “critical” rationalism.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<p>
Many things have happened since I first published <i>Against Method</i> (AM for short). There have been dramatic political, social and ecological changes. Freedom has increased — but it has brought hunger, insecurity, nationalistic tensions, wars and straightforward murder. World leaders have met to deal with the deterioration of our resources; as is their habit, they have made speeches and signed agreements. The agreements are far from satisfactory; some of them are a sham. However, at least verbally, the environment has become a world-wide concern. Physicians, developmental agents, priests working with the poor and disadvantaged have realized that these people know more about their condition than a belief in the universal excellence of science or organized religion had assumed and they have changed their actions and their ideas accordingly (liberation theology; primary environmental care, etc.). Many intellectuals have adapted what they have learned at universities and special schools to make their knowledge more efficient and more humane.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
In sociology the attention to detail has led to a situation where the problem is no longer why and how “science” changes but how it keeps together. Philosophers, philosophers of biology especially, suspected for some time that there is not one entity “science” with clearly defined principles but that science contains a great variety of (high-level theoretical, phenomenological, experimental) approaches and that even a particular science such as physics is but a scattered collection of subjects (elasticity, hydrodynamics, rheology, thermodynamics, etc., etc.) each one containing contrary tendencies [...]&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
It is clear that the new situation requires a new philosophy and, above all, new terms. Yet some of the foremost researchers in the area are still asking themselves whether a particular piece of research produces a “discovery”, or an “invention”, or to what extent a (temporary) result is “objective”. The problem arose in quantum mechanics; it is also a problem for classical science. Shall we continue using outmoded terms to describe novel insight or would it not be better to start using a new language? And wouldn't poets and journalists be of great help in finding such a language?&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
This book proposes a thesis and draws consequences from it. The thesis is: <i>the events, procedures and results that constitute the sciences have no common structure</i>; there are no elements that occur in every scientific investigation but are missing elsewhere. Concrete developments (such as the overthrow of steady state cosmologies and the discovery of the structure of DNA) have distinct features and we can often explain why and how these features led to success. But not every discovery can be accounted for in the same manner, and procedures that paid off in the past may create havoc when imposed on the future. Successful research does not obey general standards; it relies now on one trick, now on another; the moves that advance it and the standards that define what counts as an advance are not always known to the movers. Far-reaching changes of outlook, such as the so-called “Copernican Revolution” or the “Darwinian Revolution”, affect different areas of research in different ways and receive different impulses from them. A theory of science that devises standards and structural elements for <i>all</i> scientific activities and authorizes them by reference to “Reason” or “Rationality” may impress outsiders — but it is much too crude an instrument for the people on the spot, that is, for scientists facing some concrete research problem.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>

<ul>
	<li>Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its law-and-order alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>This is shown both by an examination of historical episodes and by an abstract analysis of the relation between idea and action. The only principle that does not inhibit progress is: anything goes.</li>

<li>For example, we may use hypotheses that contradict well-confirmed theories and/or well-established experimental results. We may advance science by proceeding counterinductively.</li>

<li>The consistency condition which demands that new hypotheses agree with accepted theories is unreasonable because it preserves the older theory, and not the better theory. Hypotheses contradicting well-confirmed theories give us evidence that cannot be obtained in any other way. Proliferation of theories is beneficial for science, while uniformity impairs its critical power. Uniformity also endangers the free development of the individual.</li>

<li>There is no idea, however ancient and absurd, that is not capable of improving our knowledge. The whole history of thought is absorbed into science and is used for improving every single theory. Nor is political interference rejected. It may be needed to overcome the chauvinism of science that resists alternatives to the status quo.</li>

<li>No theory ever agrees with all the facts in its domain, yet it is not always the theory that is to blame. Facts are constituted by older ideologies, and a clash between facts and theories may be proof of progress. It is also a first step in our attempt to find the principles implicit in familiar observational notions.</li>

<li>As an example of such an attempt I examine the tower argument which the Aristotelians used to refute the motion of the earth. The argument involves <i>natural interpretations</i> — ideas so closely connected with observations that it needs a special effort to realize their existence and to determine their content. Galileo identifies the natural interpretations which are inconsistent with Copernicus and replaces them by others.</li>

<li>The new natural interpretations constitute a new and highly abstract observation language. They are introduced and concealed so that one fails to notice the change that has taken place (method of anamnesis). They contain the idea of the relativity of all motion and the law of circular inertia.</li>

<li>In addition to natural interpretations, Galileo also changes sensations that seem to endanger Copernicus. He admits that there are such sensations, he praises Copernicus for having disregarded them, he claims to have removed them with the help of the telescope. However, he offers no theoretical reasons why the telescope should be expected to give a true picture of the sky.</li>

<li>Nor does the initial experience with the telescope provide such reasons. The first telescopic observations of the sky are indistinct, indeterminate, contradictory and in conflict with what everyone can see with his unaided eyes. And, the only theory that could have helped to separate telescopic illusions from veridical phenomena was refuted by simple tests.</li>

<li>On the other hand, there are some telescopic phenomena which are plainly Copernican. Galileo introduces these phenomena as independent evidence for Copernicus while the situation is rather that one refuted view —Copernicanism— has a certain similarity with phenomena emerging from another refuted view — the idea that telescopic phenomena are faithful images of the sky.</li>

<li>Such “irrational” methods of support are needed because of the “uneven development” (Marx, Lenin) of different parts of science. Copernicanism and other essential ingredients of modern science survived only because reason was frequently overruled in their past.</li>

<li>Galileo's method works in other fields as well. For example, it can be used to eliminate the existing arguments against materialism, and to put an end to the philosophical mind/body problem (the corresponding scientific problems remain untouched, however). It does not follow that it should be universally applied.</li>

<li>The Church at the time of Galileo not only kept closer to reason as defined then and, in part, even now: it also considered the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's views. Its indictment of Galileo was rational and only opportunism and a lack of perspective can demand a revision.</li>

<li>Galileo's inquiries formed only a small part of the so-called Copernican Revolution. Adding the remaining elements makes it still more difficult to reconcile the development with familiar principles of theory evaluation.</li>

<li>The results obtained so for suggest abolishing the distinction between a context of discovery and a context of justification, norms and facts, observational terms and theoretical terms. None of these distinctions plays a role in scientific practice. Attempts to enforce them would have disastrous consequences. Popper's critical rationalism foils for the same reasons.</li>

<li>Finally, the kind of comparison that underlies most methodologies is possible only in some rather simple cases. It breaks down when we try to compare non-scientific views with science and when we consider the most advanced, most general and therefore most mythological parts of science itself.</li>

<li>Neither science nor rationality are universal measures of excellence. They are Particular traditions, unaware of their historical grounding.</li>

<li>Yet it is possible to evaluate standards of rationality and to improve them. The principles of improvement are neither above tradition nor beyond change and it is impossible to nail them down.</li>

<li>Science is neither a single tradition, nor the best tradition there is, except for people who have become accustomed to its presence, its benefits and its disadvantages. In a democracy it should be separated from the state just as churches are now separated from the state.</li>

<li>The point of view underlying this book is not the result of a well-planned train of thought but of arguments prompted by accidental encounters. Anger at the wanton destruction of cultural achievements from which we all could have learned, at the conceited assurance with which some intellectuals interfere with the lives of people, and contempt for the treacly phrases they use to embellish their misdeeds was and still is the motive force behind my work.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a></li>

    Introducción

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
The following essay is written in the conviction that <i>anarchism</i>, while perhaps not the most attractive <i>political</i> philosophy, is certainly excellent medicine for <i>epistemology</i>, and for the <i>philosophy of science</i>.
</p>
<p>
The reason is not difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
“History generally, and the history of revolution in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more many-sided, more lively and subtle than even” the best historian and the best methodologist can imagine.<sup id="nota1"><a href="#notas">[1]</a></sup> History is full of “accidents and conjunctures and curious juxtapositions of events” and it demonstrates to us the “complexity of human change and the unpredictable character of the ultimate consequences of any given act or decision of men”. Are we really to believe that the naive and simple-minded rules which methodologists take as their guide are capable of accounting for such a “maze of interactions”?<sup id="nota2"><a href="#notas">[2]</a></sup> And is it not clear that successful <i>participation</i> in a process of this kind is possible only for a ruthless opportunist who is not tied to any particular philosophy and who adopts whatever procedure seems to fit the occasion?
</p>
<p>
This is indeed the conclusion that has been drawn by intelligent and thoughtful observers. “Two very important practical conclusions follow from this [character of the historical process]”, writes Lenin,<sup id="nota3"><a href="#notas">[3]</a></sup> continuing the passage from which I have just quoted. “First, that in order to fulfill its task, the revolutionary class [i.e. the class of those who want to change either a part of society such as science, or society as a whole] must be able to master <i>all</i> forms or aspects of social activity without exception [it must be able to understand, and to apply, not only one particular methodology, but any methodology, and any variation thereof it can imagine]; second [it] must be ready to pass from one to another in the quickest and most unexpected manner.” “The external conditions”, writes Einstein, “which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of experience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in the construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an epistemological system. He, therefore, must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist...” A complex medium containing surprising and unforeseen developments demands complex procedures and defies analysis on the basis of rules which have been set up in advance and without regard to the ever-changing conditions of history.&nbsp;<a href="#agme" style="font-weight:550;">[&uarr;]</a>
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Scientific education as we know it today has precisely this aim. It simplifies “science” by simplifying its participants: first, a domain of research is defined. The domain is separated from the rest of history [...] and given a “logic” of its own. A thorough training in such a “logic” then conditions those working in the domain; it makes <i>their actions</i> more uniform and it freezes large parts of the <i>historical process</i> as well. Stable “facts” arise and persevere despite the vicissitudes of history. An essential part of the training that makes such facts appear consists in the attempt to inhibit intuitions that might lead to a blurring of boundaries. A person’s religion, for example, or his metaphysics, or his sense of humour [...] must not have the slightest connection with his scientific activity. His imagination is restrained, and even his language ceases to be his own. This is again reflected in the nature of scientific “facts” which are experienced as being independent of opinion, belief, and cultural background.
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
[...] the world which we want to explore is a largely unknown entity. We must, therefore, keep our options open and we must not restrict ourselves in advance. Epistemological prescriptions may look splendid when compared with other epistemological prescriptions, or with general principles — but who can guarantee that they are the best way to discover, not just a few isolated “facts”, but also some deep-lying secrets of nature? The second reason is that a scientific education as described above (and as practiced in our schools) cannot be reconciled with a humanitarian attitude. It is in conflict “with the cultivation of individuality which alone produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings”;<sup id="nota4"><a href="#notas">[4]</a></sup> it “maims by compression, like a Chinese lady’s foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make a person markedly different in outline” from the ideals of rationality that happen to be fashionable in science, or in the philosophy of science. The attempt to increase liberty, to lead a full and rewarding life, and the corresponding attempt to discover the secrets of nature and of man, entails, therefore, the rejection of all universal standards and of all rigid traditions.
</p>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
Let us, therefore, start with our outline of an anarchistic methodology and a corresponding anarchistic science. There is no need to fear that the diminished concern for law and order in science and society that characterizes an anarchism of this kind will lead to chaos. The human nervous system is too well organized for that. There may, of course, come a time when it will be necessary to give reason a temporary advantage and when it will be wise to defend its rules to the exclusion of everything else. I do not think that we are living in such a time today.<sup id="nota5"><a href="#notas">[5]</a></sup>

<h2>&Phi;</h2>
<p>
The idea of a method that contains firm, unchanging, and absolutely binding principles for conducting the business of science meets considerable difficulty when confronted with the results of historical research. We find, then, that there is not a single rule, however plausible, and however firmly grounded in epistemology, that is not violated at some time or other. It becomes evident that such violations are not accidental events, they are not results of insufficient knowledge or of inattention which might have been avoided. On the contrary, we see that they are necessary for progress. Indeed, one of the most striking features of recent discussions in the history and philosophy of science is the realization that events and developments, such as the invention of atomism in antiquity, the Copernican Revolution, the rise of modern atomism (kinetic theory; dispersion theory; stereochemistry; quantum theory), the gradual emergence of the wave theory of light, occurred only because some thinkers either <i>decided</i> not to be bound by certain “obvious” methodological rules, or because they <i>unwillingly broke</i> them.
</p>
<p>
This liberal practice, I repeat, is not just a fact of the history of science. It is both reasonable and <i>absolutely necessary</i> for the growth of knowledge. More specifically, one can show the following: given any rule, however “fundamental” or “rational”, there are always circumstances when it is advisable not only to ignore the rule, but to adopt its opposite. For example, there are circumstances when it is advisable to introduce, elaborate, and defend <i>ad hoc</i> hypotheses, or hypotheses which contradict well-established and generally accepted experimental results, or hypotheses whose content is smaller than the content of the existing and empirically adequate alternative, or self-inconsistent hypotheses, and so on.<sup id="nota6"><a href="#notas">[6]</a></sup>

<h1>Notas</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Aquí Feyerabend parafrasea a Lenin en <i>“Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i> (1920). Lo siguiente es de la nota a pie de página original de Feyerabend:
		<blockquote>
“History as a whole, and the history of revolutions in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more multiform, more lively and ingenious than is imagined by even the best parties, the most conscious vanguards of the most advanced classes” [...] Lenin is addressing parties and revolutionary vanguards rather than scientists and methodologists; the lesson, however, is the same.<sup><a href="#nota1">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

	<li>Después de la referencia a Lenin, esta otra frase breve entrecomillada (así como la inmediatamente previa) es de un autor que no conozco. Sin embargo, es de gran importancia citar la nota a pie de página de Feyerabend, en la cual cita a Hegel en <i>Filosofía de la historia</i> (publicado postumamente en 1837):
	<blockquote>
“But what experience and history teach us is this, that nations and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted according to rules that might have derived from it. Every period has such peculiar circumstances, is in such an individual state, that decisions will have to be made, and decisions <i>can</i> only be made, in it and out of it.”<sup><a href="#nota2">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

	<li>Nota del autor:
	<blockquote>
We see here very clearly how a few substitutions can tum a political lesson into a lesson for <i>methodology</i>. This is not at all surprising. Methodology and politics are both means for moving from one historical stage to another. We also see how an individual, such as Lenin, who is not intimidated by traditional boundaries and whose thought is not tied to the ideology of a particular profession, can give useful advice to everyone, philosophers of science included. In the 19th century the idea of an elastic and historically informed methodology was a matter of course. Thus Ernst Mach wrote in his book <i>Erkenntnis und Irrtum</i> [<i>Conocimiento y error</i>, 1905]: “It is often said that research cannot be taught. That is quite correct, in a certain sense. The schemata of <i>formal</i> logic and of <i>inductive</i> logic are of little use for the intellectual situations are never exactly the same. But the examples of great scientists are very suggestive.” They are not suggestive because we can abstract rules from them and subject future research to their jurisdiction; they are suggestive because they make the mind nimble and capable of inventing entirely new research traditions.<sup><a href="#nota3">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

<li>Esta cita y la siguiente son de John Stuart Mill en <i>On Liberty</i> (1859).<sup><a href="#nota4">[&uarr;]</a></sup></li>

<li>Nota del autor:
	<blockquote>
This was my opinion in 1970 when I wrote the first version of this essay. Times have changed. Considering some tendencies in US education (“politically correct”, academic menus, etc.), in philosophy (postmodernism) and in the world at large I think that reason should now be given greater weight not because it is and always was fundamental but because it seems to be needed, in circumstances that occur rather frequently today (but may disappear tomorrow), to create a more humane approach.<sup><a href="#nota5">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

<li>Aquí el autor cita <i>Niels Bohr: His Life and Work As Seen by His Friends and Colleagues</i> (ed. Stefan Rozental, 1967):
	<blockquote>
One of the few thinkers to understand this feature of the development of knowledge was Niels Bohr: “[...] he would never try to outline any finished picture, but would patiently go through all the phases of the development of a problem, starting from some apparent paradox, and gradually leading to its education. In fact, he never regarded achieved results in any other light than as starting points for further exploration. In speculating about the prospects of some line of investigation, he would dismiss the usual consideration of simplicity, elegance or even consistency with the remark that such qualities can only be properly judged <i>after</i> [my italics] the event.” [...] Now science is never a completed process, therefore it is always “before” the event. Hence simplicity, elegance or consistency are <i>never</i> necessary conditions of (scientific) practice.<sup><a href="#nota6">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>
