The following essay is written in the conviction that <i>anarchism</i>, while perhaps not the most attractive <i>political</i> philosophy, is certainly excellent medicine for <i>epistemology</i>, and for the <i>philosophy of science</i>.
</p>
<p>
The reason is not difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
“History generally, and the history of revolution in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more many-sided, more lively and subtle than even” the best historian and the best methodologist can imagine.<sup id="nota1"><a href="#notas">[1]</a></sup> History is full of “accidents and conjunctures and curious juxtapositions of events” and it demonstrates to us the “complexity of human change and the unpredictable character of the ultimate consequences of any given act or decision of men”. Are we really to believe that the naive and simple-minded rules which methodologists take as their guide are capable of accounting for such a “maze of interactions”?<sup id="nota2"><a href="#notas">[2]</a></sup> And is it not clear that successful <i>participation</i> in a process of this kind is possible only for a ruthless opportunist who is not tied to any particular philosophy and who adopts whatever procedure seems to fit the occasion?
</p>
<p>
This is indeed the conclusion that has been drawn by intelligent and thoughtful observers. “Two very important practical conclusions follow from this [character of the historical process]”, writes Lenin,<sup id="nota3"><a href="#notas">[3]</a></sup> continuing the passage from which I have just quoted. “First, that in order to fulfill its task, the revolutionary class [i.e. the class of those who want to change either a part of society such as science, or society as a whole] must be able to master <i>all</i> forms or aspects of social activity without exception [it must be able to understand, and to apply, not only one particular methodology, but any methodology, and any variation thereof it can imagine]; second [it] must be ready to pass from one to another in the quickest and most unexpected manner.” “The external conditions”, writes Einstein, “which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of experience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in the construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an epistemological system. He, therefore, must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist...” A complex medium containing surprising and unforeseen developments demands complex procedures and defies analysis on the basis of rules which have been set up in advance and without regard to the ever-changing conditions of history.

Scientific education as we know it today has precisely this aim. It simplifies “science” by simplifying its participants: first, a domain of research is defined. The domain is separated from the rest of history [...] and given a “logic” of its own. A thorough training in such a “logic” then conditions those working in the domain; it makes <i>their actions</i> more uniform and it freezes large parts of the <i>historical process</i> as well. Stable “facts” arise and persevere despite the vicissitudes of history. An essential part of the training that makes such facts appear consists in the attempt to inhibit intuitions that might lead to a blurring of boundaries. A person’s religion, for example, or his metaphysics, or his sense of humour [...] must not have the slightest connection with his scientific activity. His imagination is restrained, and even his language ceases to be his own. This is again reflected in the nature of scientific “facts” which are experienced as being independent of opinion, belief, and cultural background.
</p>

[...] the world which we want to explore is a largely unknown entity. We must, therefore, keep our options open and we must not restrict ourselves in advance. Epistemological prescriptions may look splendid when compared with other epistemological prescriptions, or with general principles — but who can guarantee that they are the best way to discover, not just a few isolated “facts”, but also some deep-lying secrets of nature? The second reason is that a scientific education as described above (and as practiced in our schools) cannot be reconciled with a humanitarian attitude. It is in conflict “with the cultivation of individuality which alone produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings”;<sup id="nota4"><a href="#notas">[4]</a></sup> it “maims by compression, like a Chinese lady’s foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make a person markedly different in outline” from the ideals of rationality that happen to be fashionable in science, or in the philosophy of science. The attempt to increase liberty, to lead a full and rewarding life, and the corresponding attempt to discover the secrets of nature and of man, entails, therefore, the rejection of all universal standards and of all rigid traditions.
</p>

<p>
Let us, therefore, start with our outline of an anarchistic methodology and a corresponding anarchistic science. There is no need to fear that the diminished concern for law and order in science and society that characterizes an anarchism of this kind will lead to chaos. The human nervous system is too well organized for that. There may, of course, come a time when it will be necessary to give reason a temporary advantage and when it will be wise to defend its rules to the exclusion of everything else. I do not think that we are living in such a time today.<sup id="nota5"><a href="#notas">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>
The idea of a method that contains firm, unchanging, and absolutely binding principles for conducting the business of science meets considerable difficulty when confronted with the results of historical research. We find, then, that there is not a single rule, however plausible, and however firmly grounded in epistemology, that is not violated at some time or other. It becomes evident that such violations are not accidental events, they are not results of insufficient knowledge or of inattention which might have been avoided. On the contrary, we see that they are necessary for progress. Indeed, one of the most striking features of recent discussions in the history and philosophy of science is the realization that events and developments, such as the invention of atomism in antiquity, the Copernican Revolution, the rise of modern atomism (kinetic theory; dispersion theory; stereochemistry; quantum theory), the gradual emergence of the wave theory of light, occurred only because some thinkers either <i>decided</i> not to be bound by certain “obvious” methodological rules, or because they <i>unwillingly broke</i> them.
</p>
<p>
This liberal practice, I repeat, is not just a fact of the history of science. It is both reasonable and <i>absolutely necessary</i> for the growth of knowledge. More specifically, one can show the following: given any rule, however “fundamental” or “rational”, there are always circumstances when it is advisable not only to ignore the rule, but to adopt its opposite. For example, there are circumstances when it is advisable to introduce, elaborate, and defend <i>ad hoc</i> hypotheses, or hypotheses which contradict well-established and generally accepted experimental results, or hypotheses whose content is smaller than the content of the existing and empirically adequate alternative, or self-inconsistent hypotheses, and so on.<sup id="nota6"><a href="#notas">[6]</a></sup>

<h1>Notas</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Aquí Feyerabend parafrasea a Lenin en <i>“Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i> (1920). Lo siguiente es de la nota a pie de página original de Feyerabend:
		<blockquote>
“History as a whole, and the history of revolutions in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more multiform, more lively and ingenious than is imagined by even the best parties, the most conscious vanguards of the most advanced classes” [...] Lenin is addressing parties and revolutionary vanguards rather than scientists and methodologists; the lesson, however, is the same.<sup><a href="#nota1">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

	<li>Después de la referencia a Lenin, esta otra frase breve entrecomillada (así como la inmediatamente previa) es de un autor que no conozco. Sin embargo, es de gran importancia citar la nota a pie de página de Feyerabend, en la cual cita a Hegel en <i>Filosofía de la historia</i> (publicado postumamente en 1837):
	<blockquote>
“But what experience and history teach us is this, that nations and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted according to rules that might have derived from it. Every period has such peculiar circumstances, is in such an individual state, that decisions will have to be made, and decisions <i>can</i> only be made, in it and out of it.”<sup><a href="#nota2">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

	<li>Nota del autor:
	<blockquote>
We see here very clearly how a few substitutions can tum a political lesson into a lesson for <i>methodology</i>. This is not at all surprising. Methodology and politics are both means for moving from one historical stage to another. We also see how an individual, such as Lenin, who is not intimidated by traditional boundaries and whose thought is not tied to the ideology of a particular profession, can give useful advice to everyone, philosophers of science included. In the 19th century the idea of an elastic and historically informed methodology was a matter of course. Thus Ernst Mach wrote in his book <i>Erkenntnis und Irrtum</i> [<i>Conocimiento y error</i>, 1905]: “It is often said that research cannot be taught. That is quite correct, in a certain sense. The schemata of <i>formal</i> logic and of <i>inductive</i> logic are of little use for the intellectual situations are never exactly the same. But the examples of great scientists are very suggestive.” They are not suggestive because we can abstract rules from them and subject future research to their jurisdiction; they are suggestive because they make the mind nimble and capable of inventing entirely new research traditions.<sup><a href="#nota3">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

<li>Esta cita y la siguiente son de John Stuart Mill en <i>On Liberty</i> (1859).<sup><a href="#nota4">[&uarr;]</a></sup></li>

<li>Nota del autor:
	<blockquote>
This was my opinion in 1970 when I wrote the first version of this essay. Times have changed. Considering some tendencies in US education (“politically correct”, academic menus, etc.), in philosophy (postmodernism) and in the world at large I think that reason should now be given greater weight not because it is and always was fundamental but because it seems to be needed, in circumstances that occur rather frequently today (but may disappear tomorrow), to create a more humane approach.<sup><a href="#nota5">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>

<li>Aquí el autor cita <i>Niels Bohr: His Life and Work As Seen by His Friends and Colleagues</i> (ed. Stefan Rozental, 1967):
	<blockquote>
One of the few thinkers to understand this feature of the development of knowledge was Niels Bohr: “[...] he would never try to outline any finished picture, but would patiently go through all the phases of the development of a problem, starting from some apparent paradox, and gradually leading to its education. In fact, he never regarded achieved results in any other light than as starting points for further exploration. In speculating about the prospects of some line of investigation, he would dismiss the usual consideration of simplicity, elegance or even consistency with the remark that such qualities can only be properly judged <i>after</i> [my italics] the event.” [...] Now science is never a completed process, therefore it is always “before” the event. Hence simplicity, elegance or consistency are <i>never</i> necessary conditions of (scientific) practice.<sup><a href="#nota6">[&uarr;]</a></sup>
	</blockquote></li>
