This website is my personal poetic cyberspace. I am using “poetic” in two senses: (1) the principal purpose of focusing on my poetry, and (2) the etymology of the word, which is derived from the Greek ποίησις (<i>póiēsis</i>), ‘fabrication, creation, production’<sup><a id="note1-up" href="#note1-down">[1]</a></sup>, which in turn comes from the infinitive ποιεῖν (<i>poiêin</i>), ‘to make’<sup><a id="note2-up" href="#note2-down">[2]</a></sup>. This second usage, likewise, has a double sense: not only does it refer to the poems, but also to the development of the website itself, which I write in semantic HTML<sup><a id="note3-up" href="#note3-down">[3]</a></sup>, as well as with a simple and mostly classless CSS<sup><a id="note4-up" href="#note4-down">[4]</a></sup>. I started it in 2021, although some of the writings have much older roots. Navigate to the main categories via the uppermost retractable menu. Each page contains its own table of contents, like the one above this paragraph. Additionally, please note there is no need for a dark mode when reading here.

<h1><a href="#on-poetry">On Poetry</a></h1>
<p>
I understand my poetry as a cognitive synthetic nexus that involves my sensations, my thoughts, my memories. I like to read, to think, to feel. For most of my life, I have had a fundamental interest in philosophy, which I continuously cultivate. My favourite literary genre is science fiction, and I also enjoy certain kinds of fantasy. Consequently, I have an inclination towards philosophical poetry and speculative poetry, the latter a broad category than encompasses science-fictional, fantastic, and mythological themes.
</p>
<p>
While I indeed enjoy rhyme —whether in verse poetry or in prose poetry—, I find it secondary for my fruitful contact with the language art in question. To a lesser degree, I can say the same about other forms of rhythm, like accentual prosody (which nonetheless can be very enriching). This is by comparison to what I experience as cognitively stimulant via semantic nuances. A poet often is a semantic player. It is greatly pleasurable for me to have opportunities for discovery, for exploration, in poems. Lo the quest, the search, as essential movement of a perpetual cognitive desire.
</p>

<h2><a id="an-onomastic-clarification" href="#an-onomastic-clarification">An Onomastic Clarification</a></h2>
<p>
There are three collections of a Japanese-originated poetry form available in the website, about which I think is important to explain here what is repeated in their respective pages.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The <a href="philosophical-poetry.html#noesis-collection"><i>Noesis Collection</i></a> is comprised of haikus on various philosophical themes, often referencing particular historical philosophers. </li>
	<li>The <a href="speculative-poetry.html#dianoia-collection"><i>Dianoia Collection</i></a> is comprised of haikus on various science-fictional themes (as well as about the genre), often referencing particular writers, stories, or worldbuilding contexts. </li>
	<li>The <a href="miscellaneous-poetry.html#eikasia-collection"><i>Eikasia Collection</i></a> is comprised of haikus based on monolexical prompts, originally image-oriented.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In a strict sense, however, especially in the thematic aspect, those poems are not traditional Japanese haiku, nor are they precisely <i>senryū</i>, either. Nonetheless, I like adhering to the typical structure, concerning (1) syllabic metrics, and (2) seeking to pivot, as inspired by the disjuncture produced in Japanese via the <i>kireji</i> (切れ字, ‘cutting word’). Very importantly, in the spirit of this kind of poetry, I enjoy practicing its density in brevity, together with an exploration of intuition, connected with the meditative aspect it tends to have. For pragmatism, therefore, whenever I use the term “haiku” I mean it <i>sensu lato</i>, mostly in reference to my own writings. For greater accuracy, I can suggest expressions like “haikuesque” or “haiku-like” instead of “haiku”, but the latter is usually the better-known in the Occidental world.
</p>

<h2><a id="on-web-display" href="#on-web-display">On Web Display</a></h2>
<p>
To display the poems appropriately, I format them to prevent line breaks from happening at the right margin. That way, each line —whether verse or line-phrased prose— appears typographically independent, when that is my intention. Therefore, longer lines may be partially concealed to the right, depending on their length and on the screen size. If you are using a desktop computer, or otherwise any setup with keyboard and pointer, when you find strophes or stanzas that require scrolling, there are three possible ways to do so:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click anywhere inside the outline surrounding the text at issue and press the right key (&rarr;). You can then press the left key (&larr;) to return to the beginning.</li>
	<li>Click and hold inside the aforementioned outline and drag the pointer across the border. You can then do so in the opposite direction to return to the beginning.</li>
	<li>Use the horizontal scrollbar that automatically becomes visible above the bottom border when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you are using a smaller screen, like on a tablet or a mobile phone, you can either slide a fingertip or use the horizontal scrollbar. By the way, if you know some CSS, the following is the class I created for this:
</p>
<pre><code>.strophe { white-space: nowrap; }  
</code></pre>
<p>
As you can see, it is extremely simple, and while it is true that I could add the <code>nowrap</code> value to change any HTML paragraph as desired, I prefer making the adjustment via my style sheet. Not only is it what CSS exists for, but it allows experimenting more easily.

<h1><a href="#on-science-fiction">On Science Fiction</a></h1>
<p>
By the term “science fiction” I mean, to a certain degree, what the authors of the superb <i>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i><sup><a id="note5-up" href="#note5-down">[5]</a></sup> refer to as genre science fiction</a><sup><a id="note6-up" href="#note6-down">[6]</a></sup>: briefly, texts typically recognized as such by its readership, whose writers work with conventions, or protocols, that are produced in a hermeneutic spiral. Furthermore, it is very significant for me to emphasize what I like to call science fiction <i>sensu stricto</i>, which is congruent with the definition developed by Darko Suvin</a><sup><a id="note7-up" href="#note7-down">[7]</a></sup><sup><a id="note8-up" href="#note8-down">[8]</a></sup> in his <i>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre</i> (1979, rev. 2016), i.e. not exclusively determined by science, technology, or the future, but:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
[...] by the hegemonic literary device of a <i>locus</i> and/or <i>dramatis personae</i> that (1) are <i>radically or at least significantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters</i> of “mimetic” or “naturalist” fiction, but (2) are nonetheless —to the extent that SF [<i>sic</i>] differs from other “fantastic” genres, that is, ensembles of fictional tales without empirical validation— simultaneously perceived as <i>not impossible</i> within the cognitive (cosmological and anthropological) norms of the author's epoch.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
For more about this and other treatments through the history of the genre, I recommend reading the article “Definitions of SF”<sup><a id="note9-up" href="#note9-down">[9]</a></sup>, in the aforementioned encyclopedia. The following is from that source:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
In 1972 Darko Suvin defined sf [<i>sic</i>] as “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment”. By “cognition” Suvin appears to mean the seeking of rational understanding, and by “estrangement” something akin to Bertolt Brecht's <i>Verfremdungseffekt</i>, defined in 1948 thus: “A representation which estranges is one which allows us to recognize its subject, but at the same time make it seem unfamiliar.” Perhaps the most important part of Suvin's definition, and the easiest with which to agree, is the emphasis he puts on what he and others have called a novum, a new thing — some difference between the world of the fiction and what Suvin calls the “empirical environment”, the real world outside. The presence of a novum is insufficient in itself, of course, to define sf, since the different and older tradition of fantasy likewise depends on the novum.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p> 
I think that passage, whose reference predates the book that Suvin subsequently wrote (in which he repeats that definition), is elucidating, and it invites me to reinterpret some works as science fiction, or close to it, albeit not marketed as such.<sup><a id="note10-up" href="#note10-down">[10]</a></sup>

<p>
Incidentally, though I am not a software programmer, it behoves me to indicate that I concur with free (libre)<a id="note12-up" href="#note12-down"><sup>[12]</sup></a><a id="note13-up" href="#note13-down"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and open-source software <a id="note14-up" href="#note14-down"><sup>[14]</sup></a><a id="note15-up" href="#note15-down"><sup>[15]</sup></a> (FOSS or FLOSS), including the overlap with digital privacy. It is based on this interest that I use the tools and services I have selected for various functions, <i>in accordance with my necessities and within my possibilities</i> — which, naturally, tend to allow for only partially addressing the ethical problematics of this conjuncture. I think the fediverse<a id="note16-up" href="#note16-down"><sup>[16]</sup><a id="note17-up" href="#note17-down"><sup>[17]</sup></a> might have the most constructive and sustainable future. Also, you can refer to <a href="https://github.com/RobertoQSx?tab=following">my GitHub profile</a> to view the programs and developers I follow. Some of the software there is open-source, but not libre. Certainly, if you are acquainted with such matters, I also recommend the splendid and famous <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">Arch Linux wiki</a>, a trove of information.
