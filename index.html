This website is my personal poetic cyberspace. I am using “poetic” in two senses: (1) the principal purpose of focusing on my poetry, and (2) the etymology of the word, which derives from the Greek ποίησις (<i>póiēsis</i>), ‘fabrication, creation, production’<sup><a id="note1-up" href="#note1-down">[1]</a></sup>, which in turn comes from the infinitive ποιεῖν (<i>poiêin</i>), ‘to make’<sup><a id="note2-up" href="#note2-down">[2]</a></sup>. This second usage, likewise, has a double sense: not only does it refer to the poems, but also to the development of the website itself, which I write in semantic HTML<sup><a id="note3-up" href="#note3-down">[3]</a></sup>, as well as with a simple and mostly classless CSS<sup><a id="note4-up" href="#note4-down">[4]</a></sup>. I started it in 2021, although some of the writings have much older roots. Navigate to the main categories via the uppermost retractable menu. Each page contains its own table of contents, like the one above this paragraph. Furthermore, please note there is no need for a dark mode when reading here.

<h1><a href="#on-poetry">On Poetry</a></h1>
<p>
I understand my poetry as a cognitive synthetic nexus that involves my sensations, my thoughts, my memories. I like to read, to think, to feel. For most of my life, I have had a fundamental interest in philosophy, which I continuously cultivate. My favourite literary genre is science fiction (and I enjoy certain kinds of fantasy). Consequently, I have an inclination towards philosophical poetry and science fiction poetry.
</p>
<p>
While I indeed enjoy rhyme —whether in verse poetry or in prose poetry—, I find it secondary for my fruitful contact with the language art in question. To a lesser degree, I can say the same about other forms of rhythm, like accentual prosody (which can be very enriching). This is by comparison to what I experience as cognitively stimulant via semantic nuances. A poet often is a semantic player. It is greatly pleasurable for me to have opportunities for discovery, for exploration, in poems. Lo the quest, the search, as essential movement of a perpetual cognitive desire.
</p>

<h2><a id="on-haiku" href="#on-haiku">On Haiku</a></h2>
<p>
There are three collections of a Japanese-originated poetry form in the website. I think it is important to explain here what is repeated in their respective pages.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The <a href="philosophical-poetry.html#noesis-collection"><i>Noesis Collection</i></a> is comprised of haiku on various philosophical themes, including references to particular historical philosophers. </li>
	<li>The <a href="science-fiction-poetry.html#dianoia-collection"><i>Dianoia Collection</i></a> is comprised of haiku on various science-fictional themes (as well as about the genre), including references to particular authors, stories, or worldbuilding contexts. </li>
	<li>The <a href="miscellaneous-poetry.html#eikasia-collection"><i>Eikasia Collection</i></a> is comprised of haiku motivated by monolexical prompts that were based on images, along with the playful idea of excluding the image word itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In a strict sense, however, especially in the thematic aspect, they are not traditional Japanese haiku, nor are they precisely <i>senryū</i>, either. Nonetheless, I like adhering to the typical structure, concerning (1) metrics, for which I use syllables and not <i>morae</i> or <i>onji</i>, in part because I do not write them in Japanese (perhaps some day), as well as, and more significantly, (2) by seeking to pivot, inspired by the disjuncture that is a distinguishing feature of haiku, and which is mediated in Japanese by the 切れ字 (<i>kireji</i>, ‘cutting word’). Very importantly, in the spirit of this kind of poetry, I enjoy practising its density in brevity, while playing with intuition, in connection with the meditative attitude it tends to have. For pragmatism, therefore, whenever I use the term “haiku” I mean it <i>sensu lato</i>, mostly in reference to my own writings. For greater accuracy, I can suggest expressions like “haikuesque” or “haiku-like” instead, as I am sure others have, but “haiku” is better-known across the globe, and its common usage in the Occidental world started in the XIX century.
</p>

<h2><a id="on-web-display" href="#on-web-display">On Web Display</a></h2>
<p>
In order to display some longer poems appropriately, I format them to prevent line breaks from happening at the right margin. That way, each line —whether verse or line-phrased prose— can be typographically independent. This implies that longer lines may be partially concealed to the right, depending on their length and on the screen size. If you are using a desktop computer, or otherwise any setup with keyboard and pointer, when you find strophes or stanzas that require scrolling, there are three possible ways to do so:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click anywhere inside the outline surrounding the text at issue and press the right key (&rarr;). You can then press the left key (&larr;) to return to the beginning.</li>
	<li>Click and hold inside said outline and drag the pointer across the border. You can then do so in the opposite direction to return to the beginning.</li>
	<li>Use the horizontal scrollbar that automatically becomes visible above the bottom border when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you are using a smaller screen, like on a tablet or a mobile phone, you can either slide a fingertip or use the horizontal scrollbar. By the way, if you know some CSS, the following is the class I created for this:
</p>
<pre><code>.strophe { white-space: nowrap; }  
</code></pre>
<p>
As you can see, it is extremely simple, and while it is true that I could add the <code>nowrap</code> value to change any HTML paragraph as desired, I prefer making the adjustment via my style sheet. Not only is it what CSS exists for, but it allows experimenting more easily.

<h1><a href="#on-science-fiction">On Science Fiction</a></h1>
<p>
By the term “science fiction” I mean, as a starting point, what the authors of the superb <i>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i><sup><a id="note6-up" href="#note6-down">[6]</a></sup> refer to as genre science fiction</a><sup><a id="note7-up" href="#note7-down">[7]</a></sup>: briefly, texts typically recognized as such by their readership, whose writers work with conventions produced in a hermeneutic spiral. So far the same can be said about any genre, naturally, as any of them has common themes, possible trope variations, aesthetic affinities and historically influential texts. The most immediately recognizable component of the genre in question is likely the involvement of scientific topics, both theoretical and technological. But while fundamental, this is not all there is to say. I think it is very significant to emphasize what I like to call science fiction <i>sensu stricto</i>, by which I mean an orientation, partly a philosophical attitude, congruent with —yet not reducible to— the definition developed by Darko Suvin</a><sup><a id="note8-up" href="#note8-down">[8]</a></sup><sup><a id="note9-up" href="#note9-down">[9]</a></sup> in his <i>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre</i> (1979, rev. 2016), i.e. not exclusively determined by science or the future, but:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
[...] by the hegemonic literary device of a <i>locus</i> and/or <i>dramatis personae</i> that (1) are <i>radically or at least significantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters</i> of “mimetic” or “naturalist” fiction, but (2) are nonetheless —to the extent that SF [<i>sic</i>] differs from other “fantastic” genres, that is, ensembles of fictional tales without empirical validation— simultaneously perceived as <i>not impossible</i> within the cognitive (cosmological and anthropological) norms of the author's epoch.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, a scientific focus is not the absolute requirement for a given work to be classifiable as belonging to this genre, considering historical conditions of cognition. Neither is, by itself, the mere presence of industrial or post-industrial technological infrastructure. However, we do live in an epoch distinctively shaped by scientific theorization and its technological praxis — both liminal and quotidian, for specialists and non-specialists alike. Given the importance of the value humanity has available in the sciences due to their potential —both ethical and unethical, for humans and other biological organisms—, the “cosmological and anthropological norms”, or shall we say, frontiers, are indeed of a scientific disposition, influenced by it, or related to it in some relevant way. Suvin says basically the same when taking into account “real possibilities” and “ideal possibilities”, both of them as opposed to supernatural fantasy narratives, and thus positing that “science is the encompassing horizon of SF”, while clarifying this is not equivalent to “scientific fiction”. Concerning philosophy of science, I supplement by affirming that whether a person is more in agreement with Popper, Kuhn or Feyerabend (etc.) can be secondary, as in any case there are such contemporary circumstances in the first instance.
</p>
<p>
For more about other treatments through the history of the genre, I recommend reading the aforementioned encyclopedia's article “Definitions of SF”<sup><a id="note10-up" href="#note10-down">[10]</a></sup>, where the authors indicate that Suvin's perspective, while hardly the most agreeable one in its totality, has “perhaps been the most useful of all in catalysing debate on the issue.” The following is also from said entry:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
In 1972 Darko Suvin defined sf [<i>sic</i>] as “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment”. By “cognition” Suvin appears to mean the seeking of rational understanding, and by “estrangement” something akin to Bertolt Brecht's <i>Verfremdungseffekt</i>, defined in 1948 thus: “A representation which estranges is one which allows us to recognize its subject, but at the same time make it seem unfamiliar.” Perhaps the most important part of Suvin's definition, and the easiest with which to agree, is the emphasis he puts on what he and others have called a novum, a new thing — some difference between the world of the fiction and what Suvin calls the “empirical environment”, the real world outside. The presence of a novum is insufficient in itself, of course, to define sf, since the different and older tradition of fantasy likewise depends on the novum.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p> 
I find that passage elucidating. The association with Brecht's concept invites to reinterpret some works as science fiction, or closer to it than might be initially apparent, albeit not marketed as such<sup><a id="note11-up" href="#note11-down">[11]</a></sup>. Summarily, Suvin also calls this genre “the
literature of cognitive estrangement”. For the cognitive aspect we have already seen the corresponding epistemic tendencies, and in the estrangement aspect the novum plays a role (although it can also be a medium for cognition, depending on how it is implemented). Both parts of the function are inextricably linked, dialectically related, involving an oscillation between them as basic dynamics.
</p>
<p>
Concomitantly, there is a similar relational study in Gary K. Wolf's<sup><a id="note12-up" href="#note12-down">[12]</a></sup> <i>The Known and the Unknown: The Iconography of Science Fiction</i> (1979), in which he sets to “explore an image that is so ubiquitous in the genre that it transcends the label ‘icon’ — the image of the barrier between known and unknown.” He analyses specific icons, namely: “the spaceship, which represents entry into the unknown; the city, which represents subjugation of the unknown; and the wasteland, which represents the reemergence of the unknown.” He later proceeds to “shift the focus from images of the environment to images of humanity itself, first as reflected in technology through the icon of the robot, and then as reflected in the images of transformation that are represented by science fiction's various treatments of monsters, aliens, and transformed humans.” All of the aforementioned, instances of the novum that they are, have historically participated, and continue to do so, in the hermeneutic process stated at the beginning of this explanation, as some variant or another.
</p>
<p> 
Now such characterizations are not enough for a total differentiation, but must they be? Definitions are, by definition, limited, which is not incompatible with precision and profundity. I think the views presented here are most fertile. In addition to the ones already referred to, another elementary source is Wolfe's <i>Critical Terms for Science Fiction and Fantasy: A Glossary and Guide to Scholarship</i> (1986).
