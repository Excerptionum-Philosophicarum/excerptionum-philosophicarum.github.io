This website is my personal poetic cyberspace. Here I use “poetic” in two senses: (1) the principal purpose of focusing on my poetry, and (2) the etymology of the word, which derives from the Greek ποίησις (<i>póiēsis</i>) ‘fabrication, creation, production’<sup><a id="note1-up" href="#note1-down">[1]</a></sup>, which in turn comes from the infinitive ποιεῖν (<i>poiêin</i>) ‘to make’<sup><a id="note2-up" href="#note2-down">[2]</a></sup>. This second usage, likewise, has a double sense: it refers to the poems and to the website itself, which I write in semantic HTML<sup><a id="note3-up" href="#note3-down">[3]</a></sup> and with a minimalistic CSS<sup><a id="note4-up" href="#note4-down">[4]</a></sup>. I started it in 2021, although some of the writings have much older roots. Each page includes its own table of contents, like the one above this paragraph. All texts from other sources that I show here were translated by me, unless indicated otherwise. Furthermore, please note there is no need for a dark mode to read here, as I favour light texts over dark backgrounds.

<h1><a href="#on-poetry">On Poetry</a></h1>
<p>
I understand my poetry as a cognitive synthetic nexus that involves my sensations, my thoughts, my memory. I like to read, to think, to feel. Most of my life I have had a fundamental interest in philosophy, which I continuously cultivate. My favourite literary genre is science fiction (and I enjoy certain kinds of fantasy). Consequently, I have developed an inclination towards philosophical poetry and science-fiction poetry, the latter both <i>in</i> the genre as <i>about</i> said.
</p>
<p>
While I enjoy rhyme —whether in verse poetry or in prose poetry—, I find it secondary for my fruitful contact with the linguistic art in question. To a lesser degree I can say the same about other forms of rhythm, like accentual prosody (which can be very enriching). This is by comparison to what I experience as cognitively stimulant via semantic nuances. A poet frequently is a semantic player. It is very pleasurable for me to have opportunities for discovery, for exploration, in poems. Lo the quest as essential movement of a perpetual cognitive desire.
</p>

<h2><a id="on-haiku" href="#on-haiku">On Haiku</a></h2>
<p>
There are three collections of poetry of Japanese origin in the website. I think it is important to explain here what is repeated in their respective pages.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="philosophical-poetry.html"><i>Noesis Collection</i></a> consists of haiku on various philosophical themes, including references to particular historical philosophers.</li>
	<li>The <a href="science-fiction-poetry.html"><i>Dianoia Collection</i></a> consists of haiku on various science-fictional themes (as well as about the genre), including references to particular authors, stories, or worldbuilding contexts.</li>
	<li>The <a href="miscellaneous-poetry.html"><i>Eikasia Collection</i></a> consists of haiku motivated by monolexical suggestions based on images, along with the ludic idea of excluding the image word itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a strict sense, however, especially in the thematic aspect, they are not traditional Japanese haiku, nor are they precisely <i>senryū</i>, either. Nonetheless, I like adhering to a typical structure. In detail, I consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Metrics, constructing with the Spanish syllables, the quantity of which ocassionally varies by one or two. I do not use <i>onji</i> given that I do not write in Japanese (perhaps some day). Initially, I was writing haiku in English with the intention of reaching more readers around the globe. There persisted the idea of taking advantage of being a native speaker of a Romance language and its syllabic prosody, so I decided to transform all my haiku and rewrite them in Spanish. What is currently shown is first the Spanish original and then its English translation, whose metrics may differ, therefore. In that aspect of anglophone haiku I now think of <i>morae</i> instead of syllables. This is mainly considering long vowels, as well as, in the decreasing diphthongs of English (with Scottish pronunciations as exceptions), the tendency to the second vocoid not being a semivowel, unlike in Spanish (and other Romance languages).</li>
	<li>More significantly, I seek to pivot, inspired by the disjuncture that is a distinguishing feature of haiku and which traditionally is mediated in Japanese by the 切れ字 (<i>kireji</i>) ‘cutting word’.</li>
	<li>Concomitantly with the previous item, while authentic haiku regularly juxtaposes two images or other sensory instances, my derivatives not necessarily, and many times they do not do so. What they frequently juxtapose are concepts, or thought processes instead of qualia processes, especially the philosophical haiku.</li>
	<li>Understandably, my derivatives do not allude to the four seasons either, so they do not necessarily have an analogue of the 季語 (<i>kigo</i>) ‘seasonal word’. However, relevant to the science fiction haiku, it is reasonable for them to contain certain keywords pertaining to the iconography of the genre (a bit more about this in section “On Science Fiction”).</li>
	<li>Essential in the spirit of this kind of poetry, I enjoy practising its density in brevity, while playing with intuition —which leaps over the hiatus effectuated by the cut—, in connection with the meditative attitude it cultivates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For pragmatism, then, when I use the term “haiku” I do so <i>sensu lato</i>, mostly in reference to my own writings. For greater accuracy, I can suggest expressions like “haikuesque” or “haiku-like”, as surely others have, but “haiku” is better-known as generic name, having entered the vocabularies of the Occidental world at the end of the XIX century, to later spread in the middle of the XX. Furthermore, for those of us who cannot at present read haiku in Japanese, here is something superlatively valuable: the transcriptions of literal translations, element by element, “incomplete”, in contrast to relying only on final translations, fully developed, “complete” (the latter, of course, have their interpretative value, and at the same time let us remember the Italian adage <i>traduttore, traditore</i> ‘translator, traitor’). In any case, this has been constructive when learning from the oeuvre of Matsuo Bashō, Yosa Buson, Kobayashi Issa and Masaoka Shiki. For that I can recommend <i>An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bashō to Shiki</i> (1958), by USA author Harold G. Henderson.
</p>

<h2><a id="on-web-display" href="#on-web-display">On Web Display</a></h2>
<p>
To display the longer lines of some poems appropriately, I format them to prevent line breaks at their right margin. That way, each line —whether verse or line-phrased prose— can remain typographically independent. This implies some of them may be partially concealed to the right, depending on their length and on the screen size. If you are using a desktop computer, or otherwise any setup with keyboard and pointer, when you find strophes or stanzas that require scrolling, there are three possible ways to do so:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click anywhere inside the outline surrounding the text at issue and press the right key (&rarr;). You can then press the left key (&larr;) to return to the beginning.</li>
	<li>Click and hold inside said outline, and then drag the pointer across the right border.</li>
	<li>Use the horizontal scrollbar that appears automatically above the bottom border when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you are using a smaller screen, like on a tablet or a mobile phone, you can slide with a fingertip or use the horizontal scrollbar. Incidentally, if you know a bit of CSS, the following is the class I created for this format:
</p>
<pre><code>.strophe { white-space: nowrap; }  
</code></pre>
<p>
As you can see, it is very simple, and while it is true I can add the <code>nowrap</code> value to any HTML paragraph as desired, I prefer making the adjustment via my style sheet. That is what CSS exists for, after all, and it allows experimenting more easily.

<h1><a href="#on-science-fiction">On Science Fiction</a></h1>
<p>
By the term “science fiction” I mean, as a point of departure, what the authors of the magnificent <i>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i><sup><a id="note6-up" href="#note6-down">[6]</a></sup> call genre science fiction</a><sup><a id="note7-up" href="#note7-down">[7]</a></sup>: briefly, texts typically recognized as such by their readership, whose writers work with conventions and protocols produced in a hermeneutic spiral. So far the same can be said of any genre, naturally, as any of them has common themes, possible trope variations, aesthetic affinities and historically influential texts. Now, the most immediately recognizable component of the genre in question is usually the involvement of scientific matters, both theoretical and technological. But while fundamental, that is not all there is of importance. I think it is very significant to emphasize what I like to call science fiction <i>sensu stricto</i>, which is an orientation, partially a philosophical attitude, congruent with —and not reducible to— the definition developed by Darko Suvin</a><sup><a id="note8-up" href="#note8-down">[8]</a></sup><sup><a id="note9-up" href="#note9-down">[9]</a></sup> in his <i>Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre</i> (1979, rev. 2016), i.e. something not exclusively determined by science or the future, but:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
[...] by the hegemonic literary device of a <i>locus</i> and/or <i>dramatis personae</i> that (1) are <i>radically or at least significantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters</i> of “mimetic” or “naturalist” fiction, but (2) are nonetheless —to the extent that SF [<i>sic</i>] differs from other “fantastic” genres, that is, ensembles of fictional tales without empirical validation— simultaneously perceived as <i>not impossible</i> within the cognitive (cosmological and anthropological) norms of the author's epoch.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Then a scientific focus is not the absolute requisite for a given work to be classifiable as belonging to this genre, considering historical conditions of cognition. Neither are, by themselves, the mere presence of industrial or post-industrial infrastructure, nor an extrapolated very advanced technology. However, we certainly live in an epoch distinctively shaped by scientific theorization and technological praxis, both liminal and quotidian, for specialists and non-specialists alike. Given the importance of the value humanity has available in the sciences due to their potential —both ethical and unethical, for humans and other biological organisms—, the aforementioned cosmological and anthropological norms, or frontiers, are effectively of a scientific orientation, influenced by it, or related to it in some relevant way (including immanent critiques of technoscience, and also anti-scientific positions). Suvin says basically the same by taking into account “real possibilities” and “ideal possibilities”, both of them opposed to supernatural fantasy narratives, thus positing that “science is the encompassing horizon of SF”, clarifying this is not equivalent to “scientific fiction”. As for philosophy of science, I supplement by affirming that whether a person is more in agreement with Popper, Kuhn or Feyerabend (etc.) can be secondary, as in any case there are such contemporary circumstances in the first instance.
</p>
<p>
For more about other treatments through the history of science fiction, I recommend reading the article “Definitions of SF”<sup><a id="note10-up" href="#note10-down">[10]</a></sup>, in the previously referred encyclopedia, where the authors indicate that Suvin's perspective, while hardly the most agreeable one in its totality, has “perhaps been the most useful of all in catalysing debate on the issue.” The following is also from there:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
In 1972 Darko Suvin defined sf [<i>sic</i>] as “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment”. By “cognition” Suvin appears to mean the seeking of rational understanding, and by “estrangement” something akin to Bertolt Brecht's <i>Verfremdungseffekt</i>, defined in 1948 thus: “A representation which estranges is one which allows us to recognize its subject, but at the same time make it seem unfamiliar.” Perhaps the most important part of Suvin's definition, and the easiest with which to agree, is the emphasis he puts on what he and others have called a novum, a new thing — some difference between the world of the fiction and what Suvin calls the “empirical environment”, the real world outside. The presence of a novum is insufficient in itself, of course, to define sf, since the different and older tradition of fantasy likewise depends on the novum.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p> 
I find that passage elucidating. The association with Brecht's concept invites to reinterpret certain works as science fiction, or closer to it than initially apparent, albeit not marketed thus<sup><a id="note11-up" href="#note11-down">[11]</a></sup>. Summarily, Suvin also uses the phrase “the literature of cognitive estrangement”. For the cognitive aspect we have already seen the corresponding epistemic tendencies, and in the estrangement aspect the novum plays a role (yet it can also be a medium for cognition, depending on its narrative or worldbuilding implementation). Both parts of the function are inextricably linked, dialectically related, involving an oscillation between them as basic dynamics.
</p>
<p>
Concomitantly, there is a similar relational study in Gary K. Wolf's<sup><a id="note12-up" href="#note12-down">[12]</a></sup> <i>The Known and the Unknown: The Iconography of Science Fiction</i> (1979), which is to “explore an image that is so ubiquitous in the genre that it transcends the label ‘icon’ — the image of the barrier between known and unknown.” The author analyses specific icons, to wit: “the spaceship, which represents entry into the unknown; the city, which represents subjugation of the unknown; and the wasteland, which represents the reemergence of the unknown.” He later proceeds to “shift the focus from images of the environment to images of humanity itself, first as reflected in technology through the icon of the robot, and then as reflected in the images of transformation that are represented by science fiction's various treatments of monsters, aliens, and transformed humans.” All of the aforementioned, being instances of the novum, have historically participated, and continue to do so, in the hermeneutic process indicated at the start of this explanation, as some variant or another.
</p>
<p> 
Now, such characterizations are not sufficient for a <i>total</i> differentiation, but should they be? Definitions are, by definition, limited, which is not mutually exclusive with having precision and profundity. I think the perspectives presented here are most fertile. In addition to the ones already referred to, an elementary source is <i>Critical Terms for Science Fiction and Fantasy: A Glossary and Guide to Scholarship</i> (1986), also by Wolfe.
